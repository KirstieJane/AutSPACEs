# User Testing February 2024

We performed user testng with 10 participants. These user tests took approximately one hour each and all took place over Zoom. The tests were conducted between February 13-19, 2024. 
Participants were given a link to a test deployment of the AutSPACEs platform (code state at commit `c12031ce5a5911cd1814a3415d16ce0aa7c54b3d`, February 12, 2024) to explore for themselves, followed by being given tasks and asked questions by researchers. The results of these sessions are below. 

All participants consented to their results being published on GitHub for the purposes of improving the AutSPACEs platform, following [the research protocol as outlined in the research ethics documentation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/tree/main/00-project-documentation/community/user-tests).

## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 
 
  - Likes that “about” information is on front page 
  - Sentences in description are maybe too long, should be shortened down
- Registration page
  - TYPO: Open Humans vs. OpenHumans
  - White text on pink/red on registration page is hard to read
    - Generally suggests avoid red
    - White on yellow works well
- Generally lots of different colours, would prefer fewer colours
- Idea of what the platform about is: *Share stories on sensory processing experiences*

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Different trigger labels are understandable, but categories are potentially too broad (eg mental health includes suicidal ideation, etc.), hard to balance list: not getting it too long vs. categories being too broad
- Clicking on “sharing” story leads to registration page, not clear why that happens?
- Generally too many colours across pages 
- Explanatory text in pale grey (explaining opt-in) is not visible enough

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Login-flow seemed to be reasonably easy

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Open-ended profile question is not fully clear, too much text, language is quite “academic”
- Too many different colours, need to simplify it 

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Expected a sub-selection of which sense is affected (e.g. click button for “hearing-related”) 
- Placeholder text within the forms disappears as soon information is entered - makes it hard to remember what it asked for.

**6. Optional: Can you make your experience be a _public experience_, a _private experience_, _a research-only experience_** 

- Too many colours on “my stories” too 
- Finding editing of stories on “my stories” works, 
- Unclear the difference between “public” and “research”, assumption would be that “public” does also include “research” use 
- feedback on dark mode: not useful for participant, as not a personal preference/need


## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions"></a>

**What do you expect will happen next after you submit this experience?** 

- Will get moderated and then be made accessible to the public 

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- It’s a good idea to collect people’s experiences on how autistic people experience the world. Will allow other people to recognize themselves and help raise awareness for professionals. Will be a useful resource

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- Would definitely add stories, having had many experiences for many years, keen on educating people about own experiences to help others. 
- Also reading other people’s experiences will be useful to get the vocabulary to make sense of own experiences.
:::success
"And also read other people's, because one issue I find with myself is I struggle to put words on my experiences. I can't explain what I'm experiencing, and then if I get to read someone else's experience that's similar to mine, I suddenly find I have a vocabulary to explain what I'm experiencing. So I would use both, both to share and to read other people's"
:::

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Like the concept, I think the concept is great hate the colours and different fonts, too much visual noise

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- No particular concerns. Living in age of where people post a lot on social media and there’s moderation. 
- Main concern would be people taking stories out of context and sharing it elsewhere. You never know how people will use the information the future.
:::success
"I suppose the biggest concern, and I see it in so many media, is people taking the stories and using it in a different context and not referencing it. I suppose that would be the only thing, but there's always that risk - it's a difficult one...you just don't know how people are going to use the information in the future."
"...using it in a negative way when it's supposed to be positive, but once it's on the internet there's a certain level of - it's just out there."
:::

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- Some of the information on the open source nature etc. from the blurb in the participant information sheet would be good to have on the page 

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**
- If one could get notifications if people added new stories, not daily reminders but regular feedback, maybe once a week/month 
:::success
- "Would I get notifications if somebody's added a story? Would I get, like, a weekly bulletin to say, "these stories have been added"? I would like a prompt, to say, you could either choose which category you'd be interested in, or a prompt to say, "these stories have been added this week". I wouldn't want a daily one, because that would be too much - but definitely would like a prompt"
    - Q: "How frequently do you think would be ideal"
    - A: "Well, I suppose it depends - I suppose initially you'd get a lot of people doing stuff and that it would probably be less, so probably either weekly or monthly, or you'd have the option to choose"

## Demographic Info <a id="demographic-info"></a>

**What is your relationship to Autism? Any co-occurring conditions?** 

- Diagnosed with autism 

**Do you mind sharing your age/gender identity/education/professional backgrounds with us?**

- In her 50s, female, A-levels and currently long-term sick 

**How do you typically interact with digital tools (e.g. social media, websites, etc.)**

- Using iPad as main device for using the internet, interacting a lot with digital tools/internet. 
- Broad internet use: for research; social networks (FB, twitter, Instagram, all mostly reading); patient-advocacy. Mostly reading rather than writing - would not want the hassle. 

**Do you think you have special requirements around digital accessibility (e.g. visual, dyslexia)**

- Mainly colour accessibility, getting tired of reading on screens easily, very sensitive to colours & fonts due to this.

# User Test 2<a id="user-test-2"></a> 


## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-1"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- Text is large 
- Dark mode appreciated, but could be overkill to change everything
- Some websites offer different colour themes, beyond dark mode 
- Dark mode works but lack of response on front screen makes it unclear
- Suggestions made: 
  - putting “How to use AutSPACEs” further up, instead of “About AutSPACEs”
  - putting the goals, about etc. on own page instead of front page 
  - “Too much” on the front page with different purposes
    - Use tag line on front page rather than detailed text,
  - On “about us” page:
    - Should not have “contact” google form page as part of table of contents
    - Terms of use should have their own page instead of “about us” page, link from footer instead
  - Could have “help” link in navbar, not in dropdown
  - Could make dropdown for “stories” and have “view” and “share” as sub-items
- Intro text/blurb on front page is very clear

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Trigger toggles: really cool idea, but not 100% clear why this is there/how sensory processing can affect those things?
- Not clear if stories that aren’t labeled/selected don’t have any of those categories
- Trigger labels might require more explanation on the “view story” page
- “Flickering” of the updating page can be problematic (e.g. for epilepy)
- Button for expand/collapse should relabel itself to “collapse” when opened

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Red colour of “register” page is problematic (consistently highlighted amongst people)
- “About” section should have some details on who is behind this (including partner organisations)
- Should provide some explanations of the Open Humans details

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- What’s the overlap with ADHD? Could have a page with co-morbid conditions
- Unclear how the “other” trigger labels would work, as filtering is very broad?
  - Q interviewer: any missing categories that would be key to have?
  - A participant: maybe “addiction” could be an expansion of drug/alcohol misuse
- What does moderation review mean? It hasn’t been explained so far
- Page after saving profile is very wordy, confirmation page could be shorter/simpler, text could be smaller 
- Generally check colours (used in dark mode)  

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Need to clarify sharing story/experience 
- BUG: dark mode submit button doesn’t show up!

## Demographic Info <a id="demographic-info-1"></a>

**How do you typically interact with digital tools (e.g. social media, websites, etc.)**

- “Too much” doomscrolling (facebook, some instagram, youtube)

**Do you think you have special requirements around digital accessibility (e.g. visual, dyslexia)**

- Larger font size: using two screens as single laptop screen is too small
- Using captions & zoom recordings where necessary

**Other feedback**

- Sending materials earlier 
- Leaving space in time slots to run over
- Would like to keep in touch 


# User Test 3<a id="User Test 3"></a>

**Pre-usability interview questions**

Prior experience with AutSPACEs in particular & citizen science broadly? 

- No prior experience with AutSPACEs or citizen science 

## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-2"></a>

NOTE: can’t use website on phone / share screen while using website
Instead: Researcher screensharing and participant can ask her to click for him

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- Suggests a dropdown on AutSPACEs name in nav bar "about" 
- Asks to see the “about us” page & scroll 
  - Finds “about us” to be too wordy, would like a plain english, easy read format
  - Would like less text & more bullet points

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Wouldn’t have an idea where those would be 
- would go back to the top, click on “view stories”
- Wouldn’t know what stories to search for 
- Unclear that toggles work

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Find the add story page, but taken to login
  - Registration is disconcerting, doesn’t want to register into the system
  - Positive that it gives reason for having to make an account 
  - But still too much information

- Points to “register in open humans”
  - Can’t register from this page? “Create account” button should be bigger on OH 
  - Clarify “hide badge” on OH page

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Q: would you like to have a formal diagnosis option?
  - A: yes, as people might self-diagnose from some websites and aren’t actually on the autism spectrum, I would like to have that option.
- Would be good to have a trans-option too for gender
- Trigger labels still unclear here 
- Moderation ‘notification’ is unclear -> frequency, what is moderation? Who’s doing it? Etc. 

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- “Read before” item seems to duplicate the information that’s otherwise on the website, both unclear that it’s important information but also the actual text isn’t maybe useful 
- Unclear what “share your experience” means at this stage? Is this about “my whole life’s experience”? 
- Making Experience better “having a designated quiet coach” 
- Trigger labels 
  - Would check other, and put “parenting skills” 
- “Public” sharing not clear, would assume that it’s only other registered users 
- “Authorship description” could be less verbose

- Finds my stories in menu bar

## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-3"></a>

**What do you expect will happen next after you submit this experience?** 

- Expected story to be accessible via search immediately 
- Otherwise expect people to stumble upon it
- Not 100% clear on what the outcome/use of the stories is beyond going for research
  - Finds information on the “about us” page

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- Not sure, with social media feeds (e.g. tumblr & twitter) there are already things providing something similar. Might be more of a one-off use 

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Don’t have to “guess” at to many things, transparency of what the project/website is about.

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- Not really any concerns 

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- Maybe resources about the topics: people come to the website to learn and could benefit 
- Could also go beyond sensory processing topics 

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**

- If there were more stories/regular updates
- Maybe have a visual side to it 
- Generally expand it, so there’s more going on 


## Demographic Info <a id="demographic-info-3"></a>

**What is your relationship to Autism? Any co-occurring conditions?** 

- Self-diagnosed since 2021, did lots of research into it after stumbling over the topic and how it affects women

**How do you typically interact with digital tools (e.g. social media, websites, etc.)**

- Mostly lurking on different social media to see other people’s content - not comfortable putting oneself out on those services

**Do you think you have special requirements around digital accessibility (e.g. visual, dyslexia)**

- No particular accessibility needs, maybe listening for long period of time where subtitles help


# User Test 5<a id="user test 5"></a>

## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-4"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- Looks not too interactive at first glance
- “How to use the platform” -> not sure about that 
- Feedback on pictures: not really liking them - would prefer simpler photos/images
- Seems easy to navigate though
- Suggestion to have different colours, maybe some colours more associated with Autistica or autism more generally 
- Q: What do you think the goal/purpose of the site is?
  - A: Share stories with people that don’t know a lot about autism yet, giving younger people maybe a way to speak about their experiences. 
  - Could be nice to have videos of people/ambassadors sharing their stories.
  - “Can’t see any people”, to make it more personal 

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Finds the button, sets the flag, but still not very clear that mental health issues are now included
- Feedback: not everyone can read - are there audio versions? 

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Finds “add story” button on nav bar
- Pink colour on “register” page very bright, 
- Don’t know what “register in open humans” means, button is weird, redirection is weird/hard to understand, can be overwhelming
  - “Makes me want to click off this page actually”
- Too much details on the authorisation page
  - Suggestion: many youth organisations just use emails
    - Registration steps are big barrier

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Unclear what “make age (etc.) public” means
- Lots of information to fill in if answering the open-ended question
- Sensitive topics labels are unclear 
  - Not clear if applies to the reading of stories or to writing of them 
- Moderation of stories is unclear
- Language is not accessible to younger audience 
- Post-saving text makes sense, easy to understand

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Struggling about what types of stories you want me to talk about 
- Would be handy if there was a “meet the team”, and the team behind the project can send newsletters with clearer instructions of what the topic of the story should be about
  - Very limiting to collect information only by writing in this format 
  - Not sure what to write about or how many words I can write, what about, no help available on what would be useful 
- Filling story works 
- “Public sharing probably wouldn’t be live directly but would be moderated first”, but then unclear of how long moderation takes, where it would go (e.g. top or bottom of the list?) 
  - Post-save it’s shown, but should be on the page when writing a story 
- Would be good to have the success page have direct button/link for editing the story one just submitted

**6. Optional: Can you make your experience be a _public experience_, a _private experience_, _a research-only experience_** 

- Finds “my story” page okay, but then unclear where one would go and edit the story itself

## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-4"></a>

**What do you expect will happen next after you submit this experience?** 

- // Already covered above

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- Once there are recommendations in there, it would be very useful for young people in particular - but requires lots of people knowing about it and entering their experiences 
  - Otherwise not successful, really depends on the people

- Q: should be smaller age range?
  - A: probably should also be something particularly for young people, incorporate something that’s just for young people, as we feel undervalued, e.g. impostor syndrome. Young people’s page would be very helpful

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- If sharing experiences was easier I’d share
- Audio stories would be really useful if people could share that

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Didn’t like the registration process, quite difficult
- Theme wasn’t great
- Didn’t feel very personal - no pictures from anyone
- Navigation was okay-ish

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- Important to get safeguarding of people right
- Maybe having some well-being support

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**

- Would come back to understand other people’s stories, to bring awareness and help learn, e.g., coping strategies)

## Demographic Info <a id="demographic-info-4"></a>

**What is your relationship to Autism? Any co-occurring conditions?** 

- Professional working on autism, also autistic

- Using dark mode mostly, lower brightness on laptop

# User Test 6<a id="user test 6"></a>

**Pre-usability interview questions**

Prior experience with AutSPACEs in particular & citizen science broadly? 

- No prior experience with CS or AutSPACEs

## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-5"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- Easy to read, not too busy and not intimidating (e.g. not hard to read) 
- Good that not too much information to read at once but rather links out
- Scrolling down to shared stories: getting an idea of how it’ll be used 
- Like order of goals: like that sharing with each other comes first, while “educating” of non-autistic people “comes last”: “not feeling like a monkey in a zoo”
:::success
"I like the order of the goals. It feels like it values my experience as an autistic person. Sometimes autistic spaces are more about, the education comes first for non-autistic people and the experiences just seem geared towards them, but this is like it's something I could actually feel okay in. The language would let me feel included and not feel like a monkey in a zoo."
:::
- Going to “View Stories” 
  - Like that “triggering content” labels are specific 
  - But a bit confusing whether turning toggles on means they are there

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Easy to find “share story button” -> where you expect them to be from other forums 
- Go to “rgister” without issues 
- “Going to click stuff without reading” 

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Yes, without problem

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Not fully sure where ‘add a story’ page would be or how to get there
  - Uses “back” buttons to get there
  - Entering story itself is easy
- Sensitive stories seem to be clear
- For sharing options: likes that there’s a consent for research, not seen on any other pages!
- Everything mostly clear, as for other websites
- Sharing options/labels more explicit/granular than most other pages
  - Like options for filtering, as sometimes people sharing experiences can be an overload of “emotional dumping”: can decide for what one is ready to read
  - “Takes some extra spoons” but overall quite “low spoons”, more or less as for other websites
  - Two boxes, one for “what happened” & one for “what would have made it better” is good, to end on a positive instead of a negative. 

## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-5"></a>

**What do you expect will happen next after you submit this experience?** 

- As chose only for research, so no one will be able to read it beyond research team 
- But not a full image in mind on how it’ll work in detail? Will it be exclusive to the website folks or more widely? 
 - Q: if one shared publicly, what then?
     - A: expect it to be publicly accessible with all the other stories, not sure if one could interact/comment on existing stories. Many sites do that. 
 - Q: would you expect/want that?
      - A: can be good and bad. There are already lots of spaces for discussion, so having a space where one doesn’t share for getting feedback is good. Also then requires lots of rules for how to respond.
:::success
"It can be both good and bad to have comments. I can see the two sides of it. On the one hand there's already a lot of spaces where people can go to ask for responses to things so it's nice to have a space where people are just putting their story and they're not worried what people are going to say in response, so maybe they'll be a bit more honest with themselves, whereas I've seen other places where there has to be a lot of rules as to what the responses are because people give poor responses - I've experienced poor responses before on forums myself where I've said, "oh no in this situation someone made me feel uncomfortable", and people would be like, "if that makes you uncomfortable that makes us as a group look akward so stop responding like that". That's not nice as a response, I needed a supportive community not extra judgement. So it stands out as it's own thing then - it becomes it's own little pocket world of, this is different from everything else".
:::

 - Q: would you expect it to appear on the website immediately? 
      - A: not sure if this website would review before publication or not. Would make sense to do review first, so that people can’t misuse the tags etc. “there will be people that troll in safe spaces - I’ve seen that happen in forums before”.

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- Like sharing, but also trying to read some of the things, currently at the phase of, “excited to have a new website and want to see how other people use it”. 
- Could be checking it regularly, or getting obsessed with it for a while. 
- Likes the idea of reading other people’s stories and she would write, but doesn’t know what she would use most it would (depends on her situation).  

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- Generally yes, when having some time for self-reflection, but that takes some mental energy. For example having just moved, lots of things to reflect on that other people might find useful (and researchers too!) 

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Took a bit of time to find where to edit the page, but that’s mainly as the page is new to me but mostly all very simple pages. Just needs to get into that pattern

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- Probably not likely that people will go onto a niche website to share ‘fake’ stories
- Or people over-identifying themselves, but it’s not like it’ll go on the front page of the news, would need to search for it specifically 

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- Mostly everything there I’d want to use. Also has all the buttons on the bottom one needs, even if I’d not click on them (e.g. code of conduct). 

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**

- Cute design
- sense of achievement
- formed a consistent habit with websites that track media consumption (e.g. goodreads or anime tracker)
- maybe if one could classify their own experiences to follow either topics or people, or things like that.
"If there's a way to categorise the stories or if there's suggestions of topics then that would get my brain thinking and might make me want to go back"
- Bookmarking people / topics to follow
:::success
- "If there's a way to follow particular people give interesting angles on things, so I'm not always going in without an anchor - so I kind of know that there's going to be someone's side of something that I enjoy: because I enjoy the wordcraft and the part "did we get something out of this?"
- "I'd not want it to have follower points or anything like that though - that feels wrong for it because then it becomes competitive - people would know that they don't have a lot of followers, or would feel self-conscious that they do have a lot of followers. More just a way to bookmark certain people, like, this person's experience has been useful to me or they're going through a similar situation and they keep talking about it, that kind of thing"

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 
- I like colours, but I don’t think these colours are good: like the turquoise, really like the yellow, doesn’t like the black
- Prefers the light theme - white writing on the yellow doesn’t work so well - looks quite nice
- Capitalisations in AutSPACEs makes me curious 
- Relates to stories - has experiences of turning up early before crowds arrived - willing to share tips
- Not clear you can get the whole story: looks like parts are missing 
- Font is too small - but touch screen allows me to zoom in.

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Goes to the write page
- Reads through information 
- Clicks on categories
- Fulfills assignment
- Would expect to see stories which relate to the things clicked on
- Dislikes blasphemy and profanity - this would be a useful category to include
- Would prefer to have different colours in boxes to make it nicer to look at
- Too much similarity: same font and colours - this is too much: having the repetition is a sensory challenge
    -  if the colours varies it would help with remembering stories and would make the experience better
- Titles look interesting
- Having "emotional interest" would help make reading more interesting and comfortable

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Goes straight to registration page
- Reads through information 
- Likes the step by step
- A little confused by Open Humans

- Finds “data use" section very interesting
- Switching light to dark - it’s better with the white on the black 
- Doesn’t first find the link to add stories but gets there quickly unprompted
- Doesn’t use the box for a story about sensory processing but fills it in just fine
- Uses recommendation box/title box just fine

## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-7"></a>

**What do you expect will happen next after you submit this experience?** 

- Would hope it is deemed appropriate to be on the website 

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- Would share experiences publicly on a website like this - this is important for changing the mindset of health professionals; 
- would also be good to share with people who work with autistic people - many people haven’t been taught how to act with people with special needs
- Believes would help other people, as has a lot of positivity. Positivity often doesn’t often get expressed. 
- Solutions are important: would provide problem and solutions - likes having an option to give solutions. 

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- Would use it for both reading and sharing stories - would want to share uplifting stories.

- Colours and fonts - would prefer more variety, 
    - there is a particular font designed for people with autism (comic sans is better because it’s got curves) - flow and curves are better

- No concerns - “it’s a fantastic idea”

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- Sometimes felt there was “too much” information on the website - but this may have been the font and size

- Still in contact with a lot of people who have stories they would like to share. 
- Funny stories - seeing the humor in things

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit**

- Sections which could bridge the perceived divide between people with autism and neurotypical people and increase understanding - e.g. things that neurotypical people take for granted, and highlight the difference, e.g. going to movies, reading books.
- Recommendations or sharing tips about how you adapted or what you did if things were challenging.

**Pre-usability interview questions**

Prior experience with AutSPACEs in particular & citizen science broadly? 

None

## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-8"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- Likes the simplicity of the first page
- Not overwhelmed by having lots of different things to look at
- Headings in bold is good
- White line separating the menu from the content is good - drawn straight to the content 
- likes the option of the light and dark
- like that everything is in a bold font- everything is easy to read
- Likes the colour scheme - fact that it changes from turquoise to a white background - your eyes don’t get tired from the same colour 
- Finds the about paragraphs simple and likes it - would click on read more before scrolling down 
- Goes to “about” page - would skim read the “about” page
- Has some anxiety - would scan each paragraph first to get a sense of it before reading it fully and absorbing everything
- Would pay more attention to “how to use it” section
- Like how the page is spread out - clear headings with numbers, nice design
- Website is, "About sharing autistic experiences and giving a voice to autistic experience, and showing that while we have similarities we’re all different at the same time."" 

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Goes straight to “view stories” on nav bar
- Goes straight to mental health toggle and completes task easily
- Instinct would be to expect to have to search for mental health issues - wasn’t expecting to scroll and see stories, would expect to search for a key word

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Immediately sees two add stories options - on page and on nav bar
- Clicks on nav bar
- Reads through flow chart
- Finds the registration anxiety-provoking - 
    - The words in the flow chart makes it sounds a little convoluted or confusing 
- Some websites connect with previous accounts - would always opt for that option 
- Instinct when seeing the steps is, "this is convoluted, can I bothered to go through it" 
- Options to login through Facebook is good
- Goes back to steps to see what will happen when arrives on Open Humans 
- Should read “connect” project rather than “authorize” project on OH page or change instructions - different wording confusing. 
- The registration process is frustrating and would be off-putting - keeps going back to tabs to make sure is doing it right
- “Return” makes me think I have to press back or go back to something on step 4 - rephrase as “complete” 

**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Somewhat confusing what to put into “extra info” box - not inclined to put anything into it yet - new to website and don’t trust it yet with personal details - may do if you’re used to the project - would have gone through stories first so may trust box more. 
- Box feels optional, even though it’s not explicit - could make it more explicit you don’t have to fill in the box. 
- "I love to see extra context in other people's stories - I wouldn’t include it myself unless I really trusted the website, but I’d be interested to see it"
- "I'm not inclined to put anything in that section, yet. It would feel like, as I'm new to the website, I feel like I don't trust the website almost, so I feel like I wouldn't want to put anything personal at this stage, and I think once you start engaging with the website -
- You're just giving me tasks, so if I was free to explore the website myself I guess I would have gone through all the other stories and then I would have felt like, oh other people are sharing, and so therefore I would trust this box a bit more. But if I was to come straight to this I would feel reticent to put anything" 
- On some websites you see a star after the question which shows when a question “must be completed”, and you get red writing to show you haven’t completed the form.
:::success 
- "I think it's a really good thing. I really like that detail, so if I was looking at someone's story, I love context...so I'd click on another box to see extra content about another story. I think that's a really good thing. I wouldn't feel inclined to fill it in straightaway, for me personally, but it may be an option for me later on if I trusted the webstite and trusted it was okay to share my details."
:::
- Finds the “sensitive” topics options “brilliant"
:::success
"Great. Brilliant, brilliant. Don't think I would add anything else or tick anything away. Cool, no comments really about any of this it's all good."
:::
- No comments except it’s all good
- Finds this part easy
- Would check the flow chart again to make sure doing it right
- Would be inclined to click “save” 
- Suggests having an explicit message to say, “don’t forget to save your profile settings”, to remind you to click the button.
- Love the design of the “success!” page and the bold font - would go back to the tab to see what the right thing is to do next
- Would scroll to see what’s on the page
- “Yep, great - no issues with this page” 

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Inclined to click on “Read Before” - I start to think “read before what?” - read before adding your story would be better. 
- Information was not what I expected to see: it is more of an “about”
    -  expected more of a warning about how you might be emotionally affected or some sort of disclaimer. 
- Clicks on “read more” 
    - Wouldn’t expect it to open in a new tab - would expect it to open into more text below. Feels a bit shocking or jarring - feels like I’ve done something wrong - and, “oh god, have I lost my previous tab?” 
    - Page should be named “Help” - wouldn’t classify this as “read more” - should be much more explicit - make button, “help” and include a message to say this will open in a new tab
- Labels for sensitive topics - this is great
- Really like the info in each box - likes the content of both sections
- Reword heading “labels for sensitive topics” 
- 3 sections/links - this is too much - would feel a bit overwhelmed 
- About AutSPACEs box could be more hidden/optional
- The code of conduct could be added to the trigger labels content as “guidance”: group under one information panel at the top, as having them all out at once would be too much, but you could reduce the information and have a read more box which expands instead of opening in a new tab. 
- Wouldn’t immediately start writing in a box unless it was a job application or car insurance etc. - would want to analyze everything on the box first - would read through everything before starting.
- Loves absorbing knowledge, so good to have information
- Text boxes and titles are really clear 
- “You can take as much or little space as you need” 
    - this is brilliant. Clear and great not to have a word limit. 
- “What could have made your experience better?” 
    - this is a little confusing - what experience? Seems vague, but wouldn’t have come to this page straight away. 
- You could put the word “sensory” before experience - but you might not want to limit it. Add examples in the box. 
- Instinct when clicks on box when the words don’t disappear is to highlight it and delete before you start typing - would be easier if words disappear as soon as you click on box.
- You could put some more examples in the “title” box - lots of autistic people are anxious about getting it wrong
- Don’t like posting on social media - it feels like I wouldn’t want to get the title wrong
    - a lot of people have been bullied and have a sense they’re going to get things wrong, so they feel they should come up with a “popular” name or silly name for people to laugh at
    - a few examples could lessen anxiety - would help me feel better about having a title if I had examples. 
- Wants to be creative but doesn’t want to “stand out” 
- This could limit people if they got stressed 
- Interested in “sensitive topics” - instinct would be to scroll for the top and to make sure it matches info in the top
- No issues with navigating
- Sharing options are brilliant - explanation is brilliant - overall experience: nice - no issues
- Finds examples of “experience is someone else’s” really clear and useful.
- Success page is useful - would then go and find story to see 
- Would be useful to have a summary page. 
- If I made it public it would make me anxious:
    - opportunity to edit is important. 
    - summary page before you click to publish would help. 

**6. Optional: Can you make your experience be a _public experience_, a _private experience_, _a research-only experience_** 

- Recognises you can go to “my stories” and edit it.
- Knows story is private as did not click boxes - recognises this has a journaling purpose. 
- Instinct would be to read everything on Story Dashboard before scrolling down
- All understandable  
- Suggestion: have a button that shows summary on the page after submission, instead of having more links
- have a preview and clear options to go back and edit or publish - people might just want to double check they’ve got everything right. 


## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-8"></a>

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- Would definitely like to read the website and read stories - but struggles with communication with humans in general, so would not feel inclined to share story
    - but imagines might do at a later stage 
- Have found it helpful to absorb autism stuff on social media - accounts are really informative and makes you feel less alone - realise others are more like you than you thought

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Really like the colours: they’re just lovely
- Likes Big bold headings
- Most frustrating part was the 5 steps to add a story:
    - feels like there must be a shorter/quicker way to share story
    - the wording was confusing. 
- Clear spacing
- It’s a great feeling using this website to have these examples where it’s just clear
- Look at “Embrace autism” - this has been the most helpful website in my autism journey. Simple colour scheme. 

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- Not really - concerns with internet trolls, but would be surprised if they came across this as they tend to stick to social media. 
- No way of proving you’re autistic
- Stories getting into the wrong hands - but this isn’t a major concern as trolls probably wouldn’t find this corner of the web

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- All the information I needed is there

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**

- Colour scheme - feels warm and bright - big bold headings at the top
- Stories are important - that would make me return to have solidarity with people and feel less alone.

# User Test 10<a id="user test 9"></a>

**Pre-usability interview questions**

Prior experience with AutSPACEs in particular & citizen science broadly? 

Some familiarity with AutSPACEs: came to meet-ups and was involved in user testing a very early platform design. 


## Usability testing with think-aloud<a id="usability-testing-with-think-aloud-9"></a>

**1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is?** 

- I like it, it’s very clear
- The writing is nice and big and easy to read
- Likes the picture - not glaring at you
- Likes the pastel shade
- Goes straight to register page
- Goes back and reads about AutSPACEs 
- Has the text on the site read aloud
- I like the summary
- Nice big writing
- Reads stories and scrolls through carousel
    - doesn’t like that the pictures disappear when you click on a story to read it: it makes it seem like the text might have changed because the picture has gone
- Overall: I like the website and I like the pictures
- Goal of platform: "help researchers understanding sensory difficulties autistic people have (like myself really) and make the world a better place"
- I like the layout: it’s nice and clear and not cluttered. 
- I like the pastel colours
- The pictures are beautiful

**2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)**

_Explore if people understand \_why\_ they don’t see it (this is not a search)_

- Goes first to carousel
- Then goes to view stories from the nav bar
- Uses read aloud setting
- This page is slightly tricky to use with a screen reader - have to click on each part of text: it doesn’t run on automatically
- “Allow all triggering content” - expectation is that when you click it, it allows it to be shown. 
    - It would be clearer if there was a sentence or picture that says, “this has been allowed” so that you know it’s there - green on/off switch would also work. 
- Scrolls down and looks at stories - finds the one with mental health issues tagged. 
- Some of the words mean (e.g. spatial perception)
- The page has good colours - not too overwhelming - comparison with other websites which can be too bright (sometimes has to use sunglasses if the screen is too bright)
- Reading stories teaches me new stuff - likes learning new things when reading the stories 

**3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).**

- Clicks straight on “add stories” from nav bar
- Uses screen reader 
- Some people might not have the knowledge to highlight the text to have it read aloud - might be good to have a simple read aloud button on the page
- Flow chart works with a screen order and goes in the right order 
- Hard to remember the steps - once got to step 5 forgot step 1
- Goes to registration page on Open Humans and adds username and password without any issues 
- Uses screen reader on Open Humans page
- The information on the Open Humans page is unclear - not sure understands about membership; confused by project badge. 


**4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Hard to make the reading aloud stop in order to answer questions: you can pause the audio, but it makes it difficult to know where to go in the text and where to stop the audio. This makes filling in the form tricky. 
- Would be better if the text was bigger - hard to read. 
- Pause feature is tricky (problem is also issue with screen reader design)
- Would be good to have a big button next to each question to just read that question. 
- Would miss detail under boxes because it’s tricky to use with the screen reader
- Expects information under the box to belong to boxes further down
- Makes description public
- Needs more of a gap or space between profile and sensitive topics
- It’s much easier to read when it’s bigger - likes the size of the titles, e.g. where it says “Sensitive Topics” 
    - otherwise it’s a bit overwhelming. 
- Hard to process a lot of information when the text is small
- Trigger labels hard to understand - doesn’t want to talk about the “triggering” topics - makes me feel anxious. 
- Contemplates it more and likes that it is an option so people can share negative experiences
- Not sure about them as I feel uncomfortable - I’ve been assaulted in the past - but wants to see so would click on everything; 
    - wants people to listen to my stuff, so want other people to be able to share their situations. 
- Wants people have the opportunity to express the difficult things that have happened: people should be allowed to talk about this freely and shouldn’t feel ashamed or embarrassed - people feel shame and so they don’t talk about it, but they should in order to change things. 
- It’s complicated - it’s good that it’s an individual thing so if you don’t want to see it it’s fine, but if you want to share you can. 
- Good to not have option to not have too many notifications
- Unclear about the moderation process from profile page: instinct is the toggle is asking for stories to be moderated, not to be notified when stories are moderated. 
- Took a while to load success screen
- Likes that the text is big again - changing sizes is tricky because it goes from being easy to hard to read. 

**5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)**

- Goes to visit my profile to see what it looks like - surprised that it just goes back to the same page. 
- Views other stories to see what’s there - I like reading other people’s stories
- Finds it hard to write - uses computer to spell so would go back and spell check everything
- Not immediately sure how to use the trigger labels - this part is complicated. 
- Extra features are a bit heavy and overwhelming and seems like a lot - I just want to add my story. Seeing all the topics of the trigger labels is a bit frightening. 
    - Makes me anxious just to see the topics - they are upsetting topics and it’s too much to do. 
- Thinks I’ve already done the “triggering labels” part when setting up the profile - not clear that it is asking something different (content of your own story, not content you want to see)
- "It’s a bit much to have sensitive topics - It’s complicated and off-putting and makes me anxious."" 
- Would prefer to have an AI to pick up a sensitive topic rather than having to decide myself. 
- Didn’t include authorship - and so the story wasn’t submitted - this was confusing. 
- Not quite sure what the authorship description is asking 
- Success! Page is laid out really well. Blue is really nice. 

## Post-task questions<a id="post-task-questions-9"></a>

**Do you think AutSPACEs could be useful to you/Would you use AutSPACEs to share your experiences?** 

- I think I would use it but it might make me stressed.
- I’d use it if it was simpler. If you have challenges you just want things simple - and this is quite complicated. 

**Which parts could you see yourself using most? (sharing experience vs reading experiences)** 

- I like both. I like to learn about other people’s experience. 
- Maybe someone can rescue me if they understand what’s happening - they could find ways to explain similar situations so it has an impact on others who can change things 
- Suggestion: you could use AI to turn text into a video or cartoon: this would be really nice because lots of autistic people are visual, and dyslexic people are visual. 

**Which aspects did you like about using AutSPACEs? Which things surprised you/ or were frustrating? What could have been better?** 

- Nice format and colours
- Nice to read other experiences. 
- Sharing a story was hard and complicated. 

**What concerns (if any) do you have about using AutSPACEs?** 

- No concerns about sharing stuff
- People might use it as a way of finding or picking on vulnerable people - but okay as long as you don’t let people write about personal stuff publicly (this is part of the moderation process)
- You might get people to pretend to have something and they don’t

**Which information would you have needed to better understand AutSPACEs?**

- I like the clear layout - it’s important that it’s clear and simple
- It would be nice to hear about other people’s experiences and have more of that so people can understand everyone is not the same
- It would be useful if it was open to government departments for use for helping people and making the world a better place, but not to be misused by authorities to make life more difficult.

**What would bring you back to AutSPACEs after an initial visit?**

- I’m very forgetful - if you could save where to go and it was simple I’d be more likely to come back, because it’s easy to access. 
- If it’s just text it’s too bland so it would be good to have more pictures to make it more enjoyable. 
- Turning text into videos would be great 

## Demographic Info <a id="demographic-info-9"></a>

**What is your relationship to Autism? Any co-occurring conditions?** 

- Autistic, dyslexia, fibromyalgia, mental health difficulties: depression, anxiety, 

**Do you mind sharing your age/gender identity/education/professional backgrounds with us?**

- early 50s, male, studied evening classes (adult education) - GCSEs; lots of professional work qualifications, e.g. counseling, horticulture, technician, forensics

**How do you typically interact with digital tools (e.g. social media, websites, etc.)**

- Every day - make videos for YouTube, use it as a distraction

**Do you think you have special requirements around digital accessibility (e.g. visual, dyslexia)**

- Dyslexia: screen reader, spellchecker, use it to help me read and write, big text, 
- Visual: uses sunglasses to dim the brightness, needs pastel colours - not glaring screen, 
- Anxiety, overwhelm - has to be simple to use.

**Other feedback**

- Call me or message me to remind me about the time before the session (sometimes it's easy to forget)
- Initial email was a bit confusing: make the link more obvious and easy.
