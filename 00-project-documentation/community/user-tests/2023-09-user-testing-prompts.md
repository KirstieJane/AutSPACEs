##Usability testing with think-aloud
1. Browse to AutSPACEs and explore as you like: What do you think the goal and purpose of AutSPACEs is? 
2. Please can you change the kinds of experiences you see to also include mental health issues (experience should be hidden by default for trigger warning)
Explore if people understand _why_ they donâ€™t see it (this is not a search); 
3. Please can you add one yourself? create an account and login (or use the username and password we give you to login).
4. Can you fill in your profile (you can make one up if you prefer)
5. Please enter any experience (you can make one up if you prefer)
6. Optional: Can you make your experience be a public experience, a private experience, a research-only experience
