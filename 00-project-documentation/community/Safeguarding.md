# Safeguarding risks & mitigation strategies

Collectively, the AutSPACEs team together with the larger community have identified a number of potential risks that participating in different AutSPACEs events that could particularly affect vulnerable adults (e.g. autistic and co-occuring conditions). Jointly we have developed a wide range of mitigation strategies to minimize those risks. 

The team of AutSPACEs event organisers and faciliators (in particular Sophia Batchelor, Georgia Aitkenhead & Bastian Greshake Tzovaras) are responsible for the implementation of these actions.


## Risks

We identified a number of risks which could apply to interactions and events that are facilitated as part of AutSPACEs. 

| ID      | Risk |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| R1  |     Physical or verbal harassment/abuse         |
| R2  |     Lack of understanding of implications of participating in the study  |
| R3  |     Social/sensory processing and neurological differences among autistic people can lead to particular risks to the autistic population: a) interaction styles being falsely characterised or misunderstood by non-autistic people – e.g. direct forms of expression, lack of eye contact being interpreted as ‘rude’ b) sensory overwhelm c) cognitive overload d) alexithymia affecting identification and articulation of emotional responses |
| R4  |     Neurotypical bias can paternalistically over-amplify as well as systematically under-acknowledge risks specific to the autistic population. This is a risk both to participants and a reputational risk to the Turing as it would undermine the Turing’s values. |
| R5  |       Autistic people may also be affected by prior negative experiences and the stigmas and discriminatory biases of society in a way which could produce risks such as: a) having negative emotions triggered by recounting experiences or encountering resonating experiences of others; b) psychological distress from encountering stigma or prejudice, for instance from other community members; c) psychological harm caused by agency or self-expression being undermined during the research process |
| R6  |     Given the higher likelihood of autistic people having negative experiences (see risk 5), it is likely that participants share them within our events. |
| R7  |     Online environments can be hostile places and can be particularly discriminatory towards people from ethnic minorities, women, and neurodiverse people.  |
| R8  |     Left unmanaged, online methods of engagement could create unnecessary barriers to entry, biasing the participant group.   | 
| R9  |      Unsupervised interactions on online spaces come with a range of potential harms, including bullying, discrimination, prejudicial or triggering comments, and other psychologically damaging conduct.  |

Not all risks apply to all forms of engagement, further below we have mapped the risks to the different kinds of events.

## Mitigation strategies

We have implemented a number of actions to minimize and mitigate those risks: 

| ID | Control measure | Risks mitigated by the measure |
| -- | --------------- | ------------------------------ | 
| A | We implemented a [community code of conduct (CoC) and enforcement process](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md). This CoC is shared with all participants at the start of the session, including allowing for questions & clarifications. All participants of the event will have to follow the CoC. | R1, R3, R5 |
| B |     We have a participant information sheet & consent form to inform participants about the implications of participating in our study. These materials are shared with participants prior to the meeting. Participants are also given the opportunity to ask questions about them | R2 |
| C | We make it clear participants are free to leave at any time without giving a justification, and that they do not have to respond to any questions they do not wish to. | R2, R3, R5 |
| D | Have multiple facilitators available to ensure all participants’ needs are met – such as providing them with a quiet space to decompress, or access to the bathroom. | R3 |
| E | Provide all attendees with a schedule in advance including frequent breaks. | R3 |
| F | Give clear directions and a description of the working space. | R3|
| G | Hold sessions outside of rush hour. | R3 |
| H | Keep to schedule as closely as possible. | R3 |
| I | Ask group what support or adjustments they need to feel comfortable, such as dimmed lights, and follow their suggestions where possible. | R3|
| J | Check in frequently to make sure participants feel comfortable and their needs are met. |R3, R5| 
| K | Have autistic co-researchers actively involved in setting agendas and priorities to ensure alignment of goals with both participant needs and EDI strategy of the Institute | R4 |
| L | We establish a safe, trusted and respectful environment for participants to share their experiences in an appropriate way. Where needed, we can direct participants to external support at the Autistica Foundation | R6 |
| M | Show all participants how to message facilitators directly and anonymously if they wish to raise something privately | R3, R5 | 
| N | Provide all attendees with a schedule in advance including frequent breaks with zoom camera and microphone switched off. | R3 | 
| O | Give clear instructions on how to take part | R3 | 
| P | Create a calm breakout room for participants who would like less stimulation or a quiet break from the main session. | R3|
| Q | We have an icebreaking and welcoming session to increase participants’ comfort levels. Participants are also given the opportunity to ask questions | R2, R3, R5 |
| R | Arrange in-person co-working with individual(s) and tailor it to their specific needs and schedule. | R3 |
| S | Have a researcher responsible for the individual and available to support them during their stay. | R1, R3|
| T | Have a conversation with individuals prior to session so that there is understanding about what will take place | R2 |
| U | Give clear directions and a description of the working space. | R |
| V | Enquire if there are any specific conditions which would make them especially vulnerable, such as sensory sensitivities, anxiety or epilepsy, and make sure the researcher is aware of the correct procedure to follow if something occurs. | R1, R3 |
| W | Georgia Aitkenhead and Bastian Greshake Tzovaras will act as moderators of all online spaces created for AutSPACEs. They will remove or ask contributors to remove any content that infringes our values and/or code of conduct. If necessary, the research team will bar individuals (temporarily or permanently) from further contributing to the project, for instance if they persistently violate the code of conduct. | R7, R9 |
| X | We will maintain our online spaces with explanatory documentation and support anyone to engage with our online spaces should they desire and seek support | R8 |
| Y | We will offer alternatives to technically challenging processes to those who wish to contribute in other ways | R8 |
| Z | Researchers working independently with autistic adults must be informed about autism and aware of arising risks and sensitivities. | R3, R4, R5, R6 |

In addition to these existing strategies, we will: 
-  continue to maintain these mitigations that are already in place for the duration of the project and follow these actions for all events in this category.  
- reflect on the code of conduct and iterate on the basis of participant and researcher feedback, which we seek within each event (see control measures). 
- refresh at least every 12 months
