# Platform Designs

In this folder, you will find key information about the **Design** of the AutSPACEs platform. 

## Where to start. 

This is the Project Management repository for the AutSPACEs project. Part of the AutSPACEs project is the development of the AutSPACEs platform, however good design is not limited to just web applications, which is why this folder sits here. 

### How to Contribute
* If you are new to design and UX, you can get started by reading through the [design-process](./design-process/) folder which gives an overview of what design is, the design process AutSPACEs uses, and definitions for the design terminology that is used. 

* If you are returning or are a designer wanting to get involved, first read our [Contributing Guidelines](/contributing-guidelines.md) and then familiarize yourself with the resources found in this repository. 

⚠️ A quick reminder that if you would like to work on the code or development of the AutSPACEs platform (for example implementing the design system) then the repository you're in right now contains the platform's code, but this folder contains only information on the platform's design **NOT** the code.

**All contributions are wellcome!**
