# Wireframes

In this folder you will find the wireframes for the platform. 
We have used a platform called [figma]() to produce our wireframes and images of each page can be found here.

To understand how each page fits in the the platform, you can use the "platform architecture" files to get an overview.  

## How to Use the Wireframes

These wireframes are for the AutSPACEs platform, you can find the code and development work for the platform throughout this repository. 

## How to Contribute
There are many ways to get involved with the AutSPACEs project and we would love to hear your feedback on the platform's design.

#### There are 2 great ways to get involved in the platform's design:
1) join the discussion during our community calls which happen on the first and last thursday of every month (find out when the next one is happening by signing up to the mailing list [here](https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience), or 
2) opening an Issue or a Pull Request that explains:
	- the changes that you are suggesting
	- how these changes improve the usability and accessibility of the platform for the autistic community. 

You can find instructions on how to use Pull Requests and Issues in our [Contributing Guidelines](/contributing-guidelines.md) as well as other information about how to contribute to this project.
