# Design Process

This folder contains content (e.g. presentations, meeting summary notes, images etc) that we have generated throughout the process of designing and co-creating the AutSPACEs platform. We've followed a set of steps in our design process that were developed into a system called "Design Thinking". "Design Thinking" helps our designers and developers to understand, empathise, define, ideate, prototype, and test designs for the AutSPACEs platform. 

You can read more about this process below in the [Design Introduction](#design-introduction) section to gives an overview of "The Design Overview" and its steps. 

It is core to our Community Values that we work openly and with transparency. As a result, this folder will be a "work in progress" and content wil be added as we move throughout the Design Process.

## Design Introduction 

The word **“Design”** covers everything from 
- Visual Design (what it looks like)
- Interaction Design (how users interact with it)
- System Design (how the pages or components fit together)
- Interface Design (how it responses to the user), and so much more! 

These types of design fall into the category of **“User Experience Design” or UX** for short. UX is everything that affects the experience and use of a digital product. We will refer to the UX design of the platform throughout this folder. 
You can read more about UX at Adobe’s website [here](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/career-tips/what-is-ux-design/).  


### The Design Process 
There are many different design processes you can follow when developing a project. We are following a specific UX Design Process for AutSPACE called "Design Thinking". 
- We chose this process because it aligns with our focus on co-creation. Our community believes in building AutSPACEs, so that there is __nothing for us, without us__. This means that the design of the platform (and all its features) are built by, for, and with autistic individuals. 

You can view the [Presentation on the Design Process]() from one of our November Community Meet Ups to see a visual version of this process.
