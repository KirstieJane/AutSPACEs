# Autistica/Turing Citizen Science newsletter | May 2020

Hello,

As coronavirus continues to change our patterns of life and create loss, difficulty, and uncertainty for many, we first want to acknowledge your ongoing support and offer our solidarity. As the pandemic is affecting us all in different ways, please let us know if there is anything which would make it easier to be involved in the community. Email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk to let us know how we can help.

Hoping you are staying safe and well.

## Project News

It's been a busy month! The community has been growing with more people supporting us and offering input - including researchers, coders, and a new developer on the Fujitsu team who will be introducing himself for June's newsletter. A warm welcome to all - we're delighted to have you on board.

## Platform design

Fujitsu have now uploaded three videos showing slideshows of work that is being done for the platform design, and you can watch them on Youtube by following these links:

* [Sprint 1 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4f6kn5HLysc)
* [Sprint 2 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_6uOwFZRfo&feature=youtu.be)
* [Sprint 3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG-Vq8m8ELA&feature=youtu.be)

### Tell us what you think

We would love to hear from you! Your input is vital so that the project reflects your experience and expertise.

To give your feedback, please:

put your comments in our always-open google form
or email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk
The development team at Fujitsu work in cycles of 15 days called "sprints". If you want to view their work you can also read their sprint reports. These list actions taken, but are currently more suitable for those with a technical background. We are working on making them more accessible for those without a technical background next sprint.

## Presenting the project

Kirstie spoke at a Center for Research and Interdisiplinarity research seminar on 27 April 2020. The title of her talk was "Participatory science to improve autistic people's lives" and you can view or reuse her slides here, and watch the video recording on YouTube. It was sad not to be able to work for a few days in Paris with project collaborator Bastian Greshake Tzovaras but Kirstie really appreciated everyone who attended the remote presentation and stayed for a dynamic and inspiring discussion.

Researchers Georgia Aitkenhead and Otis Smith delivered a talk on 30th April on Growth through community. It was wonderful to be able to co-present and I really appreciate that Otis gave his own account of being involved in the project.

## Diversity and Inclusion

(A g): “we want to make it as accessible to as wide a scope of the autistic community as we can” Focus Group 18th September 2019

Making sure the project is accessible to a wide range of people is vital, and is a high priority for many in the community. We are always working on making the project more accessible and inclusive. A group of developers, volunteers from the community and researchers are currently working on a strategy to reach and engage more people, including those who may have complex needs or who are non-verbal. If you would like to be involved or tell us what would make the project easier for you or others you know, email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk or fill in the always-open google form.

Help us help you help everyone.

## Welcome Bot

We've installed a new "Welcome Bot" on the project's repository to guide and encourage people when they contribute. Thanks to Malvika Sharan, James Kim, and numerous testers to fix a mysterious bug that stopped it working at first.

If you're in the mood for something a little technical, have a look on GitHub and open or comment on an issue to let us know what you think!

## Upcoming

### CogX

Georgia will present our project for the CogX festival of AI, which is taking place online from 8 - 10 June. The project team has some free tickets for community members, so please email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk if you would like to attend this virtual tech conference.

### Autistica Research Festival

Adapting the yearly Discover conference, Autistica will be running a Research Festival for 2020 from 3 - 10 July.

We're excited that Kirstie Whitaker will be taking part in a webinar for the festival! We hope to see you (online) there.

## Community News

Congratulations!

Congratulations to principal investigator Kirstie Whitaker for her appointment as the Programme Lead for Open Source Tools, Practices and Systems at The Alan Turing Institute. We're excited for her to promote the collaborative co-creation processes from this project to other data science initiatives at the UK's national institute for Data Science and AI.

## Introducing Ekaterina

Every month, we're introducing a new member of the community to show the range of people involved in the project and the variety of contributions they're making. If you'd like to be interviewed, or to interview someone else, please get in touch with Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

This month, we're delighted to introduce Ekaterina Harrison. Ekaterina volunteered to join the project in September 2019. Since then, she's provided invaluable expertise in legal compliance and data protection.

Here she is:

And here she is in her own words:

I am an English-qualified solicitor with my main expertise in banking and finance. In 2019 I started studying a postgraduate course titled Innovation, Technology and Law at the University of Edinburgh. As part of this postgraduate program, I chose courses on data protection, e-commerce and law of robotics. Knowledge obtained during my studies helps me to advise the digital projects like Citizen Science initiative at the Alan Turing Institute on all aspects of the data usage and structuring of data collection in a way which is privacy-compliant. I believe it is important that scientific projects have access to legal advice and I am very happy to provide assistance on a pro bono basis.

Thank You!

You are making a big difference in creating research which can benefit autistic people and their families.
 

Very best wishes,
