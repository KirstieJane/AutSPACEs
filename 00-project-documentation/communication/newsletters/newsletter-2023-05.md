# May 2023 Newsletter 

As we are moving into the summer, have again some updates from AutSPACEs for all of you and would also love to invite you to the June meet-up:


| Date | Time | Location |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Thursday 1st June | 12:00-13:30 | Online via. Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/5232350717

Join us to hear the latest AutSPACE community updates, where our web platform development currently is and discuss how to implement the frontend to moderate experiences, as we have a number of different strategies that might work.

We've also started to set-up a standing calendar invite for our monthly community meetings. If it would be useful for your planning to have this event in your calendar as well, please email [Bastian](mailto:bgreshaketzovaras@turing.ac.uk) and he will take care of this!

You can also email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if you want to get involved or don't know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. 
They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone!

## Project News

### Future focus groups and usability testing

Helen, David, Martin & Bastian have been busy â€“ making some more progress towards our first deployable prototype! We recently got feedback on our ethics approval renewal at The Alan Turing Institute. With just some minor kinks to iron out, we hope that within the next 2 months we will be able to do some proper usability testing. Stay tuned for more updates on this very soon!

### European Prize for Citizen Science

The winners of the inaugural European Prize for Citizen Science have been announced. AutSPACEs was not awarded, but if you are interest in looking at a whole list of amazing citizen science projects that cover diversity & inclusion, you can [find the official announcement of the winners and honorary mentions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLzPih-MV9A)!

### Georgia at C\*Sci conference

Our team member Georgia Aitkenhead is currently in Phoenix, Arizona in the USA to present AutSPACEs at the international citizen science conference. She is presenting a poster and you can find a [recording of her presentation on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQCC9I4sUGQ) as well as the [actual poster on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7930597).

## May Contributor Spotlight - Martin Stoffel

Today we are spotlighting [Martin Stoffel](https://github.com/mastoffel). Martin is a member of the research engineering group at The Alan Turing Institute and has been working on the technical development of the AutSPACEs over the last months!

### Tell us a little about yourself...
I'm a relatively new member of the Research Engineering Group at the Alan Turing Institute. Before that, I was at the University of Edinburgh studying how genes evolve in wild animal populations, which I really enjoyed, though I was missing the real world impact a bit. Therefore, I'm very happy to be part of AutSPACEs now, which I feel is a really thoughtful and important project with a fantastic community and great colleagues.

### What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
I'm most happy when I'm on a surfboard, walking up in the hills or reading a book early in the morning with a large cup of coffee.

### What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
I'm mainly working on the programming side on things such as implementing a warning message when stories are edited, creating tabs to give a better overview over stories and splitting stories across pages so that people don't have to scroll so much!

### Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
On the coding side, having a look at the repository and especially the issues will give a good overview on how to contribute! For everything else, rest assured: Everyone in the team is exceptionally nice, so just get in touch!

## Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. 
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

* Communication, Engagement and Promotion
* Platform development
* Accessibility and Inclusion
* Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs
If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. 
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
