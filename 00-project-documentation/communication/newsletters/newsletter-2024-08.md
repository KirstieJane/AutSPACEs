AutSPACEs Newsletter August 2024
=======================

Hello from AutSPACEs! 

We are very excited for our next meet-up session on the 5th of September, as we've launched the AutSPACEs website as pilot and have started collecting stories. 

We're going to start our community session interactively and everyone will get a chance to use the platform and add stories with the support of the team! 

If you can't make the session but want to take part in the platform pilot just follow the link on the [agenda and notes document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159DllSMvIXOMOD6xe_EWPqEkUusESPGMITBAL_X7f6o/edit) and add your stories to the website and/or your feedback to the notes doc. 

We'll also be celebrating all the magnificent work done by 
the community, and the community itself. It's the last meet-up session being run by Georgia, so we'd also like to take a bit of time to think about how we want to preserve the community going forwards. Hope to see you there if you can make it! 

**Date:** 

Thursday 5th September

**Time:** 12:00-1:30pm

**Location:**     

   Online via. Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/523235071

If you want to influence the AutSPACEs strategy but can't make the session or if the meet-up format isn't for you, please feel free to add your thoughts, ideas, or questions to the notes document or email Georgia (gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to have your perspective included in the discussion. 

## The AutSPACEs pilot is LIVE!! 

We're delighted to be able to share with you the news that AutSPACEs is now live and you can share your stories and experiences. To try it out, go to:

https://autspaces-web.azurewebsites.net/!

You can register, sign in, read stories and add them yourself. The live version is a pilot to test the site rather than to gather data, until we find a long-term home for AutSPACEs after the Turing, where it can be used for research. 

:heartpulse: Many thanks to all of you for creating this resource! :heartpulse: 

If you have any problems, questions, or feedback you can email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.
