### Towards a Phenomenology of Autism

Project Co-PI Bastian Greshake Tzovaras and researcher Georgia Aitkenhead will be presenting on AutSPACEs as part of a working group run by Professor Jonathan Green to develop methods for a phenomenology of autism. Phenomenology refers to how the world around us is based on what we perceive. AutSPACEs and Green share the value of taking the lived experience of autistic people as being vital to understanding autism. The workshop will take place on Tuesday 25th April, and slides are available on [Zenodo](link).

### CSVConf

Bastian delivered a presentation on citizen science for the [2023 CSV Conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Argentina! The presentation focussed on good practices for conducting participatory research and citizen science, and AutSPACEs was featured as a test case. Congratulations to Bastian and everyone who has contrbuted to AutSPACEs. Slides are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/7843909). Additionally, Bastian also did [two outreach events to talk about AutSPACEs and citizen science more broadly in schools](https://www.lewibo.org/post/conference-on-data-science-argentina) in Buenos Aires, the Colegio Carmen Arriola de Marín and the Colegio Pestalozzi. 


### Submission to BSOC conference 2023

Bastian has submitted an abstract to present AutSPACEs at the 2023 [Bioinformatics Open Source Conference](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2023/). The talk, if accepted, would be an opportunity to present AutSPACEs to a different audience, and share our values and learning. The conference will take place in Lyon, France. You can [read our abstract on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/00-project-documentation/communication/applications/2023-BOSC.md).


### An evening with Dame Stephanie Shirley 

AutSPACEs collaborator Ekaterina Harrison has organised an evening with Dame Stephanie Shirely. Dame Shirely is a businesswoman and philanthropist who has supported autism research. Researcher Georgia Aitkenhead and citiizen scientist Lucinda Marsden will be joining the event. It promises to be an evening of insightful, thought-provoking and inspiring conversation. Dame Stephanie will provide us with her unique insight on a range of topics including autism, women in business and remote working. Thank you very much for engaging with us, Ekaterina, and congratulations for organising such an exciting event!

### Moderation

Susanna, James, Bastian and Georgia have completed a first draft of an academic paper to share the insights from the AutSPACEs community and our solutions and strategies with other researchers. Additionally, platform developers Helen, David, and Martin have been doing excellent work implementing the moderation strategies for the AutSPACEs platform. We are also always eager for feedback on our code of conduct and moderation processes. If you are interested in being involved in this, please email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know.


January Contributor Spotlight - Lucinda Marsden
-------------------------------------------

Today we are spotlighting Lucinda Marsden. Lucinda is an AutSPACEs collaborator, who has given valuable insights to the project since it's inception. She has been an important advocate for diverse inclusion and fair remuneration for participatory scientists. 

> I am the mother of a young person with complex autism.
>
>I promote acceptance and awareness of individuals, families, and caregivers affected by severe forms of autism by giving a voice to their realities and needs.
>
>They are a vulnerable, growing and overshadowed population and there are huge gaps in policy and services and the special attention they require.
>
>I feel my job is to listen and then give ALL autistic people a voice. I actively seek out and take part in focus groups and discussion sessions where I can share my lived experience and ideas for how to make autism research serve everyone, not just the easiest to reach.
>
>I strongly advocate for diverse inclusion and fair remuneration for autistic people and caregivers involved in autism research. Otherwise, charities and researchers risk discriminating against the very groups they are trying to help, whom, in many cases, cannot work and as a result live below the poverty line. No one works for nothing and nor should caregivers and autistic people. Our knowledge is worth something.
>
>I was asked by the Head of Priors Court school www.priorscourt.org.uk to join their research board.
>
>I presented with the Alan Turing Institute at CogEx.
>
>I am an @womenofyear alumna.
>
>In my spare time, I am a writer of fiction and non-fiction and I like to run (slowly) and read a lot - not at the same time.
>
>Lastly, I love this recent Twitter quote from father, director, writer and teacher, Stephen Unwin (@RoseUnwin)
>
>"In our championing of the many splendid things that so many learning disabled and / or neurodivergent people can do, we must be careful not to marginalise or forget those who can do less."

Get involved
------------

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*   Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*   Platform development
*   Accessibility and Inclusion
*   Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions)

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. We highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! Follow this link for Getting Started with GitHub: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html
