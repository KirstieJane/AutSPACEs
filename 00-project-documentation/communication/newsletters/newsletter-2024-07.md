AutSPACEs Newsletter July 2024

Hi from AutSPACEs! 

We're no longer using TinyLetter to send out our newsletter. Instead, we're now managing our mailing list using Turing's CRM and the email address AutSPACEs@turing.ac.uk. To share our newsletter with others who might be interested please ask them to email us at AutSPACEs@turing.ac.uk and we will add them to the mailing list. You can also message us using this address if you want to be removed from the mailing list. 

With the summer even having arrived in London, things have slowed down a bit over the last weeks, but we want to **use our upcoming meeting on August 1st to plan for the future of AutSPACEs and hope to see many of you there!**

If you want to influence the AutSPACEs strategy but can't make the session or if the meet-up format isn't for you, please feel free to add your thoughts, ideas, or questions to the notes document or email Georgia (gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to have your perspective included in the discussion. 

## Plannning the next steps of AutSPACEs

With the platform being ready to be deployed and used, it's now time to think about what should be coming next. In the spirit of co-created citizen science, we would like to use the time in our upcoming community meeting on Thursday 1st to brainstorm and decide these next steps with all of you. 

We would love to have many of you attend if possible, but don't worry if you can not make it, we will send around a summary after the meeting!

## Citizen Science at "EASST/4S"

Last week, Bastian was in Amsterdam at the joint meeting of the _European Association for the Study of Science and Technology_ (EASST) and the _Society for Social Studies of Science_ (4S). There he gave a talk titled ["Citizen Science plaforms between democratisation and impact metrics"](https://zenodo.org/records/13124100) that was co-prepared with former AutSPACEs contributor Katharina.
