Project News
------------

### Updates from AutSPACEs User Testing  


### Autistica Webinar

Georgia, Bastian, James and Suzanna will be presenting for an Autistica webinar on AutSPACEs. The webinar will discuss the AutSPACEs project team's work with autistic communities exploring the co-creation of online content moderation guidelines to address issues such as online abuse, safety and well-being.

The webinar will take place on **October 5th 6-7pm** and will be held **online via Zoom**. You can sign up to join by following this link: https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/autistica-webinar-co-designing-online-platforms-for-sensory-processing-tickets-719705306947?aff=oddtdtcreator

### NHS England Research Evidence Talk 

On the 7th November, Bastian and Georgia will be presenting their work into building a participatory, citizen-science platform investigating sensory processing and autism. The talk is for NHS England as part of their research evidence series. It will focus on the importance of community involvement in research and the need to make environments more suitable for those with sensory processing differences. 

### AutSPACEs represented internationally

During October, Bastian will be representing AutSPACEs and citizen science more broadly at a number of different international events: He will first teach a PhD course on Citizen Science at the University of Southern Denmark and then present a poster on AutSPACEs at the first [_Citizen Science for Health_](https://www.citizenscience4health.nl/) conference at the University of Twente in the Netherlands! And thanks to the work of [_Lecturers Without Borders_](https://lewibo.org/), Bastian will also give two school lectures on citizen science in Denmark and Germany, respectively! 

### A website for Autistic women 

We'd like to share this wonderful resource from a member of the AutSPACEs community. *The Autistic Woman* is a website which gives support to autistic women and portrays the lived experience of an autistic woman: https://theautisticwoman.co.uk/ 

September Contributor Spotlight - David Sarmiento
-------------------------------------------

This week we're spotlighting David. David is a member of The Turing's Tools Practices and Systems team and has been working magic navigating the systems and structures of academia to make sure AutSPACEs is fully supported and ready to go!

>## Tell us a little about yourself...
>
>Hi, I'm David, Research Project Manager at the Turing. 
I was born and raised in Andalucía, mostly in Sevilla with roots in Granada, and studied engineering as I was fascinated with robots and technology.
That's still true, sort of, but always felt we had forgotten how to properly ask why. So I turned to sociology.
>
>Now I try to bring social science into technology in my role as project manager by actively shaping processes and ecouraging discussions that look beyond artefacts and into what effects they have for people and society.
>
>## What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
>
>Ah, this depends on the season but hiking and woodworking are clearly two of the most present at the time. The latter is probably an excuse to buy tools but I have made some spoons, a table and have a rocking horse in the making.
>
>This has led me to participate in the Edinburgh Tool Library and its repairs team, a great community project that encourages sharing, repairing and building together.
>
>## What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
>
>I have been working on some of the hidden requirements of research projects so others can focus on delivering an amazing platform.
>
>Right now I am working on the ethics and data protection assesment submission so we can go live!
>
>## Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
>
>Contribute! Community and open project really need your input, don't think you do not know enough or are not the person to make a contribution.
>
>Apart from that, listen and engage, help create the space you want to be in.

Get involved
------------

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*   Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*   Platform development
*   Accessibility and Inclusion
*   Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions)

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. We highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! Follow this link for Getting Started with GitHub: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html
