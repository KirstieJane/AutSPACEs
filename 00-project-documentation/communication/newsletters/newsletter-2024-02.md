Paid opportunitiesÂ 
===================

We are co-designing a citizen science platform with a community of autistic people. The platform will be used to gather qualitiative data about how autistic people are influence by sensory processing differences in their daily lives, with the end goal of collecting data which will inform positive changes to environments so they are more accesible and better suited to autistic people. Participatory research is core to the AutSPACEs approach, and people with lived experience of autism have been involved at every stage of the project in order to ensure that we create a citizen science platform which meets the needs and priorities of those for whom there is most at stake.

AutSPACEs Co-Writer
-------------------

We are currently in the final stages of developing the platform, to launch later in 2024. This includes writing and proofing text which will give a background to the project, explain the research topic of sensory processing, and guide users on how they can interact with the platform. We are looking to contract the services of a writer with lived experience of autism to co-write the copy for the platform with the research team and the wider community.

**We are looking for an established freelancer who is already able to produce invoices.**

If you'd like to apply please message Georgia with:

*   A CV or your preferred way of demonstrating your experience
*   A short position statement, including an explanation of your interest in working with AutSPACEs.
*   A sample of your writing or a link to a website where we can read your writing.

We are looking for someone that could do this work over the course of March.

If you have any concerns or questions about the application process or the role please email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk before the application deadline.

Graphic Designer/Illustrator
----------------------------

In response to community feedback and to improve both accessibility and experience, the project seeks to commission a series of illustrations. The illustrations should help convey the purpose of the project and platform, make its main functionalities clear and provide a welcoming feeling.

These images must be clear and appeal to a diverse range of autistic people. It is important to consider accessibility requirements, and to harmonise with the existing design system.

The images will also be used in presentations about AutSPACEs, as well as in other communications, such as newsletters and Twitter posts. The candidate will deliver 5 designs and work closely with the AutSPACEs team to make sure their designs are integrated into the platform.

Blog Post
---------

Georgia & Bastian have written a short blogpost about what we've learned from testing the AutSPACEs platform after the first wave of user testing. This has now been published on the Software Sustainability Institute and you can read it by following this link: Your blog post has been published at [https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/user-testing-citizen-science-platform](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/user-testing-citizen-science-platform). Many thanks to everyone who took part! We've learnt a huge amount from your feedback and insights.

User Testing
------------

Over the last two weeks we have completed 10 more user tests with different people, most of them who were new to AutSPACEs! Thank you so much to everyone who took part. We've learnt lots already and it's been really helpful to see how the feedback from previous testing has changed how easy the website is to use. We've also got some useful input on the next set of changes to make on the platform. Thank you so much to everyone who took part or expressed interest. It's been great to see the website in action!
