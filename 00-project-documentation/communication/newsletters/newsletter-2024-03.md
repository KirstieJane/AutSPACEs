## AI UK 2024

The whole Turing has been busy this month, running [AI UK](https://ai-uk.turing.ac.uk/programme/)! The event featured three main stages – Conversation, Future and Research – as well as hands-on workshops, and the Turing Hub for networking and idea exchange. AutSPACEs was represented by a discussion panel on the theme of _"Nothing About Us Without Us"_, hosted by Georgia and featuring our community member James Scott. We were joined in that discussion by Helena Hollis and Margaret Colling from "[The People's Panel on AI](https://connectedbydata.org/projects/2023-peoples-panel-on-ai)" run by [Connected by Data](https://connectedbydata.org/). The Panel is a project to bring citizens into the realm of AI to make informed decisions. The slides from the panel discussion are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10817152), and we will share the video recording when it's made available. 

There was also a lightning talk by AutSPACEs co-PI Bastian, who spoke about AI for multiple long-term conditions and how to engage the public in that type of research. 

The Turing will be uploading videos of the sessions from AI UK 2024, and you can subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AI_UK) to see them as soon as they’re released.

## User Testing

Many thanks to everyone who contributed to the second wave of User Testing of the AutSPACEs platform. The anonymised notes from the sessions will soon be available to view on our public GitHub repository and we'll share the link as soon as it's ready. The insights and feedback gathered have been invaluable for testing the changes we made after the first wave of user testing and for identifying new tasks to take to improve the platform. 

## AI panel in Florence

Last week, Bastian attended the _The European Festival of Journalism and Media Literacy_, to join a panel on _Artificial intelligence – Which skills do I need_?. Moderated by Lee Hibbard, the panel consisted of writer Maria Farrell, computational linguist & YouTuber Letiția Pârcălăbescu, and Bastian. You can read Bastian's blog about the event here: https://tzovar.as/VOICES-festival/. 

## AutSPACEs at the conference of the European Citizen Science Association

AutSPACEs will be represented at the 2024 conference of the European Citizen Science Association in Vienna, which will take place April 3-6. Our team member Bastian will be attending and will present a poster on all the recent progress that AutSPACEs has been making! If you are attending: Our poster will be presented during the first poster session on April 3rd at 5pm.

## Learning Disabilities, Autism and Neurodivergence Bill: consultation

The Scottish government is working on a bill to promote neurodiversity on the basis that by better protecting, respecting and championing the rights of people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent people, all of Scotland can benefit. This is not affiliated with AutSPACEs, but we thought it might be of interest to out community - so if you'd like to influence Scottish policy on autism please follow this link to take part: https://consult.gov.scot/mental-health-unit/learning-disabilities-autism-neurodivergence-bill/
