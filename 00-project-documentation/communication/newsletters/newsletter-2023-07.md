### New team member - Obinna

A very warm welcome to our newest team member, Obinna Ofomah. Obinna is interning with The Turing's Research Engineering Group and will be working with the development team to help build the AutSPACEs platform. You can read more about him in the Spotlight section below. 


### Moderation Paper Pre-print Published!

We have now published a pre-print titled, "How to co-create content moderation policies: The case of the AutSPACEs project". The paper shares the steps taken to co-create the moderation strategies for AutSPACEs, unfolding some of the challenges and solutions, and explaining next steps. The paper is published online at SocArXiv (https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2xe7/) and is open to be read and downloaded by anyone. Thanks especially to Suzanna Fantoni and James Scott who have co-led on moderation for AutSPACEs! 

The paper has also been submitted to the journal Data & Policy as a translational article. 


### AutSPACEs at Bioinformatics Open Source Conference

Our team member Bastian Greshake Tzovaras will be presenting our work with AutSPACEs at this year's Bioinformatics Open Source Conference in Lyon, France. The conference brings together researchers, software developers and others in the field of developing open source tools for biology to learn from each other. Beyond his talk, Bastian will also be part of a panel on "Open & Ethical Data Sharing"

### AutSPACEs at the Citizen Science 4 Health Conference.

From 29 October to Wednesday 1 November 2023, the first international Citizen Science 4 Health conference will happen University of Twente Enschede, the Netherlands. Bastian will be delivering a poster presentation for the conference. It will be a great opportunity to demo our work to a wider citizen science audience that is particularly interested in health, and will include researchers, medical practitioners, patients and other stakeholders.


July Contributor Spotlight - Obinna Ofomah
-------------------------------------------

Today we are spotlighting Obinna Ofomah. Obinna is a member of The Turing's REG team and has been doing fantastic work implementing community recommendations for the AutSPACEs platform.

>## Tell us a little about yourself...
>
>Obinna is an intern at Turing and currently pursuing a master's degree at Northumbria University Newcastle. With background in chemical engineering, he had 4 years of experience in the upstream sector of the energy industry as a Service Engineer. In this role, he collaborated with a team of experts to enhance oil productivity by remediating  well damages.
>
>During his time designing chemical systems for well intervention, he acquired proficiency in Python and SQL, which eventually sparked his interest in data science as a career path. Over time, Obinna has worked in various analytical projects spanning across different industries.
>
>Currently, he is studying the prevalent traits associated with mental health condition alongside other health data science projects.

>## What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
>
>Participating in high-intensity sports such as football, table tennis, and jogging brings me immense joy as it not only keeps me physically fit but also mentally sharp. Engaging in these activities has become an integral part of my life, as they provide a perfect outlet for stress and a means to stay active and energized. The thrill of competing in sports like football and table tennis fuels my passion for athleticism, while the meditative quality of jogging allows me to clear my mind and find inner peace. Each session spent on the field or the court rejuvenates me, making me more focused and ready to take on life's challenges.
>
>Besides sports, music holds a special place in my heart. It serves as a powerful form of expression and comfort during both happy and challenging times. Whether it's listening to soul-stirring melodies or playing an instrument myself, music connects me to my emotions and brings a sense of serenity to my soul. It has the incredible ability to uplift my spirits and provide solace when words alone cannot convey the depth of my feelings.
>
>
>## What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
>
>I am working alongside Helen to improve the search strategy for the AutSPACEs project. This NLP integrated feature ensures that a story is listed or returned if it is of the same context as the searched word.
>
>
>## Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
>
>Making a valuable contributions starts with a good understanding of the project. By delving deep into the details of the each task, contributors can truly immerse themselves in the project. A thorough understanding of the problem-statement would allow team members to be more proactive and can adapt swiftly to any unforeseen issues that may arise during the project's execution.
>
>Moreover, effective communication stands as my go-to tip for successful collaborations. Within any team setting, clear and concise communication serves as the backbone of efficient workflow. By encouraging an open and transparent dialogue, team members can readily share their ideas, concerns, and feedback. This fosters a collaborative environment where everyone's perspectives are valued and taken into consideration.
