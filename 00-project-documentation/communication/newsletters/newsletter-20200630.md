# Autistica/Turing Citizen Science Newsletter | June 2020

Hello,

June has been an exciting month for the citizen science project.

Our community is continuing to grow, and it's been lovely to see people getting involved in lots of different areas, use their skills, learn new ones, and get creative.

Email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.

They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Hoping you are staying safe and well.

## Project News

Platform design

Thanks everyone who's already told us what they think of the platform designs! You can let us know anything which important to you, but there are also a specific set of questions the team have about the designs. We would love to hear your thoughts. Find more information at: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/project-management/wireframes/community-questions.md

### Tell us what you think

We would love to hear from you! Your input is vital so that the project reflects your experience and expertise.

## Presenting the project

We presented the project as part of a panel discussion for CogX 2020.

CogX 2020 presentations have been uploaded to YouTube and you can watch them by following this link: https://youtu.be/yjtLKjTHCI0. Georgia's presentation starts 11:45 minutes into the video. Her slides are publicly available on Zenodo and can be downloaded by following this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3886557

## Workshops

Thanks to Malvika Sharan of The Turing Way project for running a GitHub session with the Fujitsu team! If you would like to learn some technical skills and join in on GitHub we can support you with free lessons and demonstrations. Please email Georgia: gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

## Upcoming

### Autistica Research Festival

Adapting the yearly Discover conference, Autistica will be running a Research Festival for 2020 from 3 - 10 July.

We'll be hosting a webinar about the project on Wednesday 8 July, from 3:30 â€“ 4:30pm. Join us and join in!

## Introducing Paul

Every month, we're introducing a new member of the community to show the range of people involved in the project and the variety of contributions they're making.

If you'd like to be interviewed, or to interview someone else, please get in touch with Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

This month, we're delighted to introduce Paul Crayson.

Paul is a developer at Fujitsu and the latest member to join the team working on the citizen science project. He's made amazing contributions helping to strategise community involvement, reviewing designs and processes, and learning GitHub and Django. Paul had his birthday this month - ðŸŽ‰HAPPY BIRTHDAYðŸŽ‰ from all of us.

Here he is:

Paul preferred to be interviewed over Zoom instead of responding in writing, and asked Georgia to edit. So here he is in his own words, edited and transcribed by Georgia:

Iâ€™m 58 years old, it was my birthday on the 7th June. I live in Camberley, or Frimley to be precise, but I havenâ€™t always lived here, I lived in North London for most of my childhood. I was always very clever at school in maths and science, I got very good A level grades, and I went to Liverpool university and studied Physics, and got a First class degree.

I really loved physics. I would have gone into Physics for work, but I did work in a research place, but it turned out to be working with computers - that just happened to be the project I was working on - and I had to upskill to be able to do the project. I actually patented the method that I used to compress maps, and that patent was used in developing sat-navs. I didnâ€™t get anything out of the patent because itâ€™s the company that benefits not you, but itâ€™s nice to say that youâ€™ve registered a patent â€“ that youâ€™ve invented something. Physics and computing are both logical, although some of itâ€™s not so logical, because you have to suspend belief.

Probably the most difficult experience was before I knew I was autistic, because Iâ€™ve always found it really difficult to socialise.

Itâ€™s different when Iâ€™m in a work situation, because itâ€™s in a situation where we get introduced, by the virtue of the fact that weâ€™re working together. But if I used to go to parties I used to just stand there saying not a word to anyone. I had no idea how to break into a conversation. All my autism is to do with communications. Iâ€™m really bad at writing, and if I can avoid having to write anything I will, which is Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re writing this blog and not me. I do struggle to get my point across, and Iâ€™m not very good at summarising so it might take me a long time to get something out that someone else could get out in a smaller out of time.

Autism is weird. People react in completely different ways than one would expect people to react to things, and not knowing that I had autism obviously made a big difference to my life. I think my life would have been more successful if Iâ€™d known that I had autism years ago. I just wondered all those years what was wrong with me, and I saw countless psychiatrists, and no-one could get to the bottom of what was wrong with me â€“ if somebodyâ€™s got autism, and itâ€™s not known, then they come across like theyâ€™re a bit weird or something. But maybe autistic people are normal, and neurotypical people are the weird ones. Present company accepted of course!

To be honest, I didnâ€™t know anything about this project until a couple of people suggested that it would be ideal for me to work on. It was a colleague who is connected with Autistica. Basically, I was sent home because of my diabetes, and I couldnâ€™t do my normal work at home because I built laptops. Iâ€™m really glad he did connect me to the project.

I find good about it the fact that Iâ€™m doing something more.

I used to like doing software development and Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m doing software development again. Whatâ€™s challenging is thereâ€™s so much to learn.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™d say to other people joining the project. I find that a very difficult type of question to answer, but Iâ€™ll try. If you have a love of development, and youâ€™re interested in autism, then this would be ideal for you.
