We're getting very close to being able to launch the platform, so in this session, we'll be discussing how to share and promote AutSPACEs How do we explain it, show its value, and make sure people know about it? We'll also have some time for some festive games and chatting.

Project News

### :star2: Congratulations Katharina :star2: 

A massive congratualtions to Dr. Katharina Kloppenborg who has been awarded her PhD. Katharina did user testing for AutSPACEs and has been a wonderful contributor to the project so we're delighted by the news! Here's Katharina's description of her research: 

"In my PhD research, I wanted to find ways to help people who use research methods to answer questions about their health, like 'What affects my sleep quality?' or 'Which grasses make my allergies worse?' This is called 'personal science' or 'self-research.' Because doing research is not easy, people doing this often meet online or offline to talk about their experiences and help each other.

I learned from this community that they would like to have an online platform to share what they know and learn from each other. So, with the help of community members, I created a website where people can write about their projects, make guides on topics they know well, and read what others have shared. Anyone can read or add to the platform. You can check it out at: https://wiki.openhumans.org.

Sharing experiences and learning from each other is also important in AutSPACEs. Before my PhD, I worked with AutSPACEs, and it taught me how crucial it is to create platforms together with the people who might use them, as their needs can be different from what a designer thinks. Also, I learned that usability tests can tell us more than just if a platform works well. By talking with participants, we can learn a lot beyond the main study task.”


### NHS England Research Evidence Talk 

On the 7th November, Susanna, Bastian and Georgia presented their work into building a participatory, citizen-science platform investigating sensory processing and autism. The talk was for NHS England as part of their research evidence series. It focussed on the importance of community involvement in research and the need to make environments more suitable for those with sensory processing differences. You can view the slides for the presentation here: https://zenodo.org/records/10078936. 


November Contributor Spotlight - Jonathan Green. 
-------------------------------------------

This week we're spotlighting Jonathan Green. 

>## Tell us a little about yourself...
>
>I am Professor of Child Psychiatry at University of Manchester, and a clinical Child Psychiatrist at the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. This means that I am a medical doctor who has specialised in paediatrics, child development and then psychiatry, which I did in London and Oxford before moving to Manchester, where I’ve set up a research group and clinical service for autism and neurodiversity in young children, along with the developmental consequences of early trauma. For the last 20 years I’ve been particularly excited about developing early intervention supports for autistic children and testing their effectiveness. We work with parents using video feedback to help them understand and respond effectively to their neurodiverse child’s development and communication. The PACT (https://www.pacttraining.co.uk/) and  IBASIS (http://research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/ibasis/) interventions have been shown effective and are now implemented in the UK and in 30 countries worldwide where we train. PACT itself has also been adapted for non-specialist delivery in low resource settings in South Asia, where we are currently doing a large implementation project, in Nepal, Sri Lanka and India, called NAMASTE (https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/namaste/), which is, for the first time in global health, an integrated early detection and care pathway for autistic children.
>
>## What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
>
>I really enjoy living in Manchester with my family, and with the beautiful countryside around here, in which I do a lot of cycling. I’ve also always painted since childhood and have a studio at the bottom of my garden. In the last 20 years I’ve had a number of exhibitions of work, both on my own and with my wife who is a textile artist.
>
>## What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
>
>We have realised that there is a real lack of what we call a “phenomenology” of autism; that is a proper and deep understanding of what it is that is distinctive about everyday autistic experience compared to non-autistic; in feeling, thinking, perception and understanding of the world. Of course there has been a lot of writing by autistic people that has given real and vivid insights into this, but what we want to do is a more systematic study of autistic experience across the variety of Neurodiversity, aiming to be as representative of as possible within the autism community. As part of this we’ve been working with the AutSPACES project to develop an online platform, where it is safe and confidential for autistic people and others to register their deep experiences, so that we can get a great idea of the breadth and diversity of autistic experience. This has never been done before scale and we think the work with AutSPACES will be an important part of allowing us to do this. So we are very excited about the joint project with you.
