### ESCA conference 2024

AutSPACEs has been accepted for a poster presentation at the 2024 [European Citizen Science Conference](https://2024.ecsa.ngo/), which will be held in Vienna from 3-6 April. For the conference, we will be presenting on the AutSPACEs platform and sharing our participatory approach with an international academic community of citizen science experts. It will be an amazing opportunity to showcase the platform and all the fantastic inputs of autistic contributors. 

### AutSPACEs ethics submission

We've submitted an ethics application for AutSPACEs which was a rigorous process demonstrating that we have been careful to uphold values of consent, equity, and impact-based research. This will mean we are in a position to use the data collected by the platform for research when it's launched. A massive thank you to David Sarmiento Perez for your hard work! 

Get involved
------------

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*   Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*   Platform development
*   Accessibility and Inclusion
*   Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. We highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
