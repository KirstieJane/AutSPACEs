### Platform

Callum and Helen have made amazing progress developing the autism platform, and we'd love to show you there work in the next meet-up!

You can also see design work as well as steps taken to create the design in [the platform design folder of our GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience/blob/master/platform-designs/wireframes/platform-prototype-21-02-2022.md). We are also working on the platform development through issues and pull requests on GitHub. If you're interested in helping develop the platform or giving feedback please [check out our issues on GitHub](github.com/alan-turing-institute/autSPACEs/issues).

We'll also soon be looking to gather feedback from the AutSPACEs community on the platform via. user testing sessions. If you are interested in being involved in this, please email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know.

### Moderation

Susanna, James, Bastian and Georgia are currently turning the work on moderation into an academic paper to share the insights from the AutSPACEs community and our solutions and strategies with other researchers. We are also always eager for feedback on our code of conduct and moderation processes. If you are interested in being involved in this, please email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know.

### Software Sustainability Institute

Georgia has been selected as a [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/) fellow for 2023, with a focus on neurodiversity and community. If you have any priorities or ideas you would like Georgia to bring to the SSI, please email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk).

Get involved
------------

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

*   Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*   Platform development
*   Accessibility and Inclusion
*   Moderation

We'll talk again about the different areas and routes to involvement in our meet-up session on the 2nd February, so please do join in so we can **make AutSPACEs work for you**.

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs) If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions)

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! Follow this link on Getting Started with GitHub: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html
