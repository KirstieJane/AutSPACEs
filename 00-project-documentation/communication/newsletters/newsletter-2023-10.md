Hi from AutSPACEs!

Happy Halloween! We hope you've been enjoying the spooky season, or if Halloween isn't your thing that you have some other kinds of fun and relaxation lined up as we make our way into winter. Our next meet-up session is coming up this week, on Thursday 2nd November. Join us for all the latest AutSPACEs updates and opportunities, and to influence the next stages of the project. In the upcoming session, Susanna Fantoni will share an analysis of user testing, and we'll be discussing emerging issues and priorities for the project.

**Date:** Thursday 02 November 2023

**Time:** 12:00-1:30pm

**Location:**

Online via. Zoom: [https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/5232350717](https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/5232350717)

We’ve started to set-up a standing calendar invite for our monthly community meetings. If it would be useful for your planning to have this event in your calendar as well, please email [Bastian](mailto:bgreshaketzovaras@turing.ac.uk) and he will take care of this!

Email [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if you want to get involved or don't know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. They can sign up by following this link: [https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience](https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience).

### Presenting AutSPACEs internationally

Bastian is in the Netherlands presenting on AutSPACEs at the 2023 Citizen Science 4 Health conference. Bastian is presenting a poster on "Co-Designing for inclusion: Lessons from the AutSPACEs project". We expect that this sharing of our learned lessons can support and inspire others that aim to develop co-led research efforts with diverse communities and in particular those which typically have been marginalized by academic research to avoid some of the issues we encountered. Furthermore, we hope that we will be able to learn from others that have already tried similar approaches within their own fields or domains, sparking mutual learning. You can view and download the poster online at Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/10034307](https://zenodo.org/records/10034307).![](https://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/8ea4701bb0c4c26e216ea688823fc7b224a1353f/images/c7ed52ba-8a96-4f59-d84c-0dd3bc2b6529.png)

###   
First User Tests Now Complete

At the end of September, Georgia and Bastian conducted a series of user tests with autistic people to see how we can improve the AutSPACEs platform. They were amazingly helpful with a lot of consensus around things which could be changed to make the experience of using the platform better. The notes from the sessions have now been written up and you can read them online if you're curious: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/00-project-documentation/community/user-tests/user-test-notes.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/00-project-documentation/community/user-tests/user-test-notes.md). Thanks again to everyone who took part. It was fantastic to have your insights and we've been working hard to make changes to the platform based on your feedback. We've now applied for funds to be able to run more user tests, and we'll let you know in this newsletter as when we start recruiting.

### NHS England Research Evidence Talk

On the 7th November, Susanna, Bastian and Georgia will be presenting their work into building a participatory, citizen-science platform investigating sensory processing and autism. The talk is for NHS England as part of their research evidence series. It will focus on the importance of community involvement in research and the need to make environments more suitable for those with sensory processing differences.

October Contributor Spotlight - Alex Morgan
-------------------------------------------

This week we're spotlighting Alex. Alex has given lots of useful insights and feedback for AutSPACEs and we're thrilled to have her on board and supporting the project.

### Tell us a little about yourself...

After a lifetime feeling I was speaking a second language without a phrase book, two years ago, at the age of fifty-eight, I took an AQ50 test ‘for fun’ and was stunned to discover I was autistic. Suddenly, all my difficulties interacting with the world and the rest of the human race made sense. A few months later, the result was confirmed with a formal diagnosis.  
  
Since then, I’ve founded theautisticwoman.co.uk, the UK’s only comprehensive online source of autism information for women (and others) by an autistic woman. A journalist all my working life, I’ve also had a novel and a camping handbook published. I’m currently looking for an agent and publisher for my memoir, Mothertongue: One woman’s guide to the language of autism, which explodes the gendered myths surrounding the condition to reveal its true impact on women.  
  
Now I try to bring social science into technology in my role as project manager by actively shaping processes and encouraging discussions that look beyond artefacts and into what effects they have for people and society.

### What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?

When I’m not writing, or raging about the misuse of apostrophes, I enjoy yoga and Pilates, and spend as much time as possible outdoors with my husband, fell walking, wild camping and rowing. A British Rowing qualified coach and member of the international Border Rowers group, I helped set – and still hold – two indoor rowing endurance world records.

### What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?

I was thrilled to take part in AutSPACEs’ user testing, sharing my impressions of the website’s appearance, wording and ease of navigation.

### Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:

Don’t assume that other people know better: your opinions matter, and AutSPACEs is a really important project. So don’t be shy, trust your judgement, and go ahead and share your thoughts and experience
