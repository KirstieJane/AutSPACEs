June Newsletter 2023
=======================


Hi from AutSPACEs! 

This month is pride month, so we'd especially like to celebrate our LGBTQ+ members and express solidarity with LGBTQ+ rights. Our next meet-up session is coming up on Thursday 6th July. Join us for all the latest AutSPACEs updates and opportunities, and to influence the next stages of the project. We will be discussing options and planning next steps for user testing, as well as sharing our recent work. We'd also love to get your thoughts on making user profiles, and what information we need to collect from users. 

**Date:** Thursday 06 July 2023

**Time:** 12:00-1:30pm

**Location:**     

   Online via. Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/5232350717

We’ve started to set-up a standing calendar invite for our monthly community meetings. If it would be useful for your planning to have this event in your calendar as well, please email [Bastian](mailto:bgreshaketzovaras@turing.ac.uk) and he will take care of this!

Email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if you want to get involved or don't know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. They can sign up by following this link: [https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience](https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience).

Best wishes for everyone!

### Hack Week

This month, members of the Research Engineering Group (REG)at The Alan Turing Institute took part in their second annual “Hack Week”. Hack week is a time when the group collaborates, and hones their data science and programming skills on projects ranging from making a REG chatbot, managing project allocations, to teaching a virtual T-Rex to walk via reinforcement learning or picking the best Pokemon team using genetic algorithms. A twitter thread with the projects descriptions can be found here: https://twitter.com/turinghut23/status/1669692047203225601?s=20.

### C\*Sci Conference

Georgia is back from Phoenix, Arizona where she presented on AutSPACEs at an international citizen science conference. We had lots of wonderful feedback about the project, especially the community member contributions, as well as lots of people interested in collaborating, so we're excited to make new connections and share learning with other citizen scientist researchers.

### ASD Publics - Public space, play and neurodiversity

Earlier in the year, Georgia Aitkenhead, Helen Duncan, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras and Otis Smith presented on AutSPACEs for an online seminar investigating Public space, play and neurodiversity: Challenges towards an urban European agenda. Their presentation, along with a range of other interesting project presentations which were part of the seminar, is now available to watch on [YouTube](www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SfQeF1dwaM). 


June Contributor Spotlight - David Llewellyn-Jones
-------------------------------------------

Today we are spotlighting David Llewellyn-Jones. David is a member of The Turing's REG team and has been doing fantastic work implementing community recommendations for the AutSPACEs platform.

>## Tell us a little about yourself...
>I joined the Alan Turing Institute in February and the AutSPACEs project shortly after. So far my experiences of both have been really positive. I'm a long-time fan of open source, both using and contributing where I can. AutSPACEs, with it's collaborative development model, is a great extension of this. So I'm particularly enjoying the fact we're working alongside members of the autistic community; using real co-development, not just collecting feedback.
>
>Before the Turing I worked at a company called *Jolla* developing Sailfish OS, a largely open source privacy-oriented smartphone operating system (an alternative to iOS or Android). Before that I spent many years working in academia as a researcher in areas related to maths, software development and computer security.
>
>## What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
>
>Many years ago, before I'd had to make any big life decisions, I believed you had to keep your job and hobbies separate to prevent work from sucking the life out of your passions. So as I loved computers I committed never to work in software engineering.
>
>I completely failed with that and now do software development at work (AutSPACEs!) and then relax at weekends by working on open source projects. The good news is that I was wrong: I now get to do what I love during both work *and* free time.
>
>I also enjoy single-player and story-driven computer games. Some of my favourites include Sunless See/Skies, Celeste, Alien: Isolation, the Rocksteady Batman games (it's not fighting, it's dancing!), the BioShock series, the Blackwell series, TombRaider (completed all 17), Dishonored, Dreamfall, Samorost, Thief, Ico... Right now I'm fighting sand zombies in Metro Exodus.
>
>## What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
>
>The AutSPACEs front-end was already well-developed when I started, so I've been picking up tickets to complete specific tasks, working alongside Helen, Martin, Bastion, Georgia and the rest of the talented AutSPACEs team.
>
>So far I've worked on unit tests, the moderation system and general housekeeping. I'm currently working on the user profile page. There are still some decisions to be made about how it should work, so I'm hoping we'll get to discuss it at the next AutSPACEs meetup. So far the meetups have been one of the most motivating highlights of AutSPACEs. The discussion is always lively, insightful and respectful.
>
>## Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
>
>There are so many ways to contribute, but choose something you're passionate about: design, collaboration, joining the meetups, documentation, *ideas about how things really ought to work*, dev pipelines, code...
>
>If you've some experience with GitHub and Python, a great place to start is by getting the environment [up-and-running](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/dev_readme.md). The instructions *look* horrific on first glance but it's actually not so bad, [we can help](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs#get-in-touch), and if you run into difficulties then letting us know is already a useful contribution.

Get involved
------------

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

We have identified the following areas where we need your help:

*   Communication, Engagement and Promotion
*   Platform development
*   Accessibility and Inclusion
*   Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs). If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

[https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions)

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. We highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility! Follow this link for Getting Started with GitHub: https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html

### Connect with us

You are also welcome to email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) and we will support you to be involved or answer any questions you might have.

As always, a huge thank you is due to everyone in the community for all of your ongoing efforts and wonderful contributions. You are making a big difference in creating research which can benefit autistic people and their families.

Very best wishes,

Georgia, Sophia, Bastian and David
