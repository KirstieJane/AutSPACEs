# March Newsletter

Hello,

Thanks for being a part of AutSPACEs. 
In London we've been enjoying some of the first warm Spring days and blue skies of 2023, as well as enduring some dramatic hail! 
We hope you and your loved ones are well, and we're happy to be able to share with you the progress we've been making this past month.

In April there will be no meet-up. Given that the month is filled with holidays (including Easter, Passover and Eid!) we will be taking a break. 
But we will have a meet-up session in May and are excited to show you all the prototype of the AutSPACEs platform! 

Email Sophia or Georgia to let us know if you want to get involved or don’t know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us.
They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone!

## Project News

### Submission to EU prize for citizen science

We've made a submission to the _European Union Prize for Citizen Science_ with AutSPACEs! 
This year will be the first year in which the prize will be awarded to recognize projects that advance knowledge through the empowerment of civil society! The award will be awarded annually by Ars Electronica on behalf of the European Commission and is open to all initiatives in the European Research Area. Beyond a grand prize there are also two awards for Diversity & Collaboration and Digital Communities. 

You can [read our application for AutSPACEs on GitHub](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/blob/main/00-project-documentation/communication/applications/2023-EU-CS-Prize.md) and the results will be announced on May 22, 2023. 

### CSV Conference 2023

Our project Co-PI, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, will present AutSPACEs at the CSVConf 2023 in Buenos Aires, Argentina on April 20. 
CSVconf is a community conference for data makers everywhere, featuring stories about data sharing and data analysis from science, journalism, government, and open source. Traditionally, the talks are recorded and publicly released after the conference!

### C\*Sci Conference 2023

Researcher Georgia Aitkenhead will present AutSPACEs for the 2023 C\*Sci Conference in Arizona. 
The conference is organized by the _Citizen Science Association_ and brings a focus to cutting-edge and evidence-based practices from many contexts, and connects people from across those contexts to highlight areas of innovation, share ideas and insights, and forge stronger relationships and practices across the field. 
A light hybrid programme will be available for those who would like to participate online.

### Moderation Paper

A sub-team of the AutSPACEs community is currently on the final stretch of completing a first draft of an academic paper focussing on moderation strategies for the AutSPACEs platform. 
The paper will share our outputs and methods, and contextualises our moderation approach within a wider context. 
Many thanks to everybody involved in this invaluable and innovative work. We hope to have more to share on this by the end of April!

### AI UK 2023

Hosted by The Alan Turing Institute, AI UK 2023 was an in-depth exploration of how data science and AI can be used to solve real-world challenges. 
We were delighted that associated research projects, The Turing Way and AIM RSF, were showcased in AI UK's exhibition space. 
It was encouraging to see that community-based practice, participatory research, and open source collaboration, some of the core values of AutSPACES, were well-represented topics and important discussion points. 

## March Contributor Spotlight - Georgia Aitkenhead

Today we are spotlighting Georgia Aitkenhead. Georgia is a researcher at The Alan Turing Institute and is a passionate advocate of neurodiversity and inclusive practices in research. 

> ### Tell us a little about yourself…
>
>I’m a researcher at The Turing and I've been involved in AutSPACEs since the beginning. 
>I was totally inspired by the depth of thought and the strong ethical foundations that AutSPACEs was built on. I knew I wanted to be part of it. 
>Before I joined The Turing I was a fast streamer for the UK Civil Service, most recently at the Foreign Office. 
>I've also done a whole lot of other things, like teaching neurodiverse kids in China and doing history tours at Kensington Palace. 
>I did my BA and MA both in English literature - so quite a range of things! 
>
>### What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
>
> I love reading and writing! 
> Especially poetry, so I would love any recommendations! 
> I discovered that one of my favourite poets, Selima Hill, is autistic. 
> She has an incredible acuity and originality, and is a proof (not that any is needed) that autistic people can be creative and fabulous artists. 
> I've also been doing some ghostwriting recently which is pretty fun! Other than that, I play saxophone, and I've also recently got into needle felting thanks to a friend's encouragement.
>
>### What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
>
>I've been involved in a whole lot of different aspects of the AutSPACEs project - reviewing pull requests on GitHub, running focus groups and workshops, writing and designing research protocols, presenting for conferences, and working one to one with community collaborators. 
>Out of everthing I've been involved in, working with autistc community members is definitely my favourite. 
>I always find it exciting and I learn so much!
>
>### Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
>
>As a member of the AutSPACEs community, you can be comfortable because the project is ultimately for you. 
>There's a huge amount of variety and scope when it comes to contributing, from leading and making decisions to helping with small but important details. 
>So my advice would be if you're curious, get in touch with me, Bastian, or Sophia directly and we can support you and make sure that what you do for AutSPACEs is meaningful and interesting to you, and that you can put your skills to good use. 
>The meet-up sesions are also a great way to take part! 
>If anything is confusing or challenging it's up to us to make it clear for you, so please do just ask! 

## Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas.
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

    Communication, Engagement and Promotion
    Platform development
    Accessibility and Inclusion
    Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs

If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. 
You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the “discussion” tab, where you can share your views:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions

If you’re not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, The Turing Way Book has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!

You are also welcome to email Sophia or Georgia and we will support you to be involved or answer any questions you might have.

A huge thank you is due to everyone in the community for all of your ongoing efforts and wonderful contributions.
You are making a big difference in creating research which can benefit autistic people and their families.

Very best wishes,

Georgia, Sophia, and Bastian
