# February 2023 Newsletter 

Hi everyone! Up in the Northern Hemisphere we are slowly moving towards spring and the days are starting to get longer. This month we have again some updates from AutSPACEs for all of you and would also love to invite you to the March meet-up:


| Date | Time | Location |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Thursday 2nd March | 12:00-13:30 | Online via. Zoom: https://turing-uk.zoom.us/j/5232350717 |

Join us to discuss the moderation approach for the platform, potential demographics questions we should include in AutSPACEs and other community updates!


Email [Sophia](mailto:sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk) or [Georgia](mailto:gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk) to let us know if you want to get involved or don't know where to start, and feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. 
They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Best wishes for everyone!

## Project News

### Platform development

Helen, Callum & Bastian have been busy â€“ making some more progress towards our first deployable prototype! The integration with Open Humans is now fully implemented, a basic moderation approach exists and there are just some last few bugs that need to be ironed out before we can share more updates.


### European Prize for Citizen Science

This year will be the first year in which the [**European Union Prize for Citizen Science**](https://ars.electronica.art/citizenscience/en/opencall/) will be awarded to recognize projects that advance knowledge through the empowerment of civil society! The award will be awarded annually by Ars Electronica on behalf of the European Commission and is open to all initiatives in the European Research Area. Beyond a grand prize there are also two awards for *Diversity & Collaboration* and *Digital Communities*, which both sound like a great fit for what AutSPACEs is doing!


## February Contributor Spotlight - Helen

Today we are spotlighting [Helen Duncan](https://github.com/helendduncan). Helen is a member of the research engineering group at The Alan Turing Institute and has been working on the technical development of the AutSPACEs over the last months!

### Tell us a little about yourself...
I've been a member of the Alan Turing Institute for just over one and a half years. Before that I was working in physics and chemistry departments in universities doing crystallography and writing programs to generate models of interesting materials. I spent a couple of years living in Edinburgh. It was the most wonderful city and I miss it. Even the hills!

### What are your favourite hobbies/things to do?
I have an interest in sewing. I have a lot patterns, loads of fabric, and tonnes of half-finished projects, but very few finished garments to show for it. I think that is quite standard for the hobby though.

### What have you been working on for the AutSPACEs project?
Callum and I have been working on the backend of the website - implementing some of the solutions provided by the community. Most recently I have added search functionality to the stories and have been trying to make sure that the way users' experiences are handled and displayed is consistent across all pages.

### Give your best tips and tricks for contributing:
I think one of the best things about working on such an open and wide-reaching project is the ability to see what other people are working on. So my top tip would be to have a look around, see who has contributed and what they have to say or what they have done.

Also document what you've done. It may make sense to you at the time but two months later it may not, and for other collaborators it is really useful to see the thought process or steps that were taken to achieve a goal.

## Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas. 
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

* Communication, Engagement and Promotion
* Platform development
* Accessibility and Inclusion
* Moderation

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs
If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement. 
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
