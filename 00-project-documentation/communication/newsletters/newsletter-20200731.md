# Autistica/Turing Citizen Science Newsletter | July 2020

Hello, 

Hope you're all doing well and getting to enjoy the summer. It's been an unusual few months, and if you feel like time is passing strangely, you're not alone! Thank you for being engaged with us and continuing to support the project. It's inspiring to be able to do work with such committed and passionate people.

Email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk to let us know if we can help you with involvement, and do feel free to share this newsletter to anyone who you think would be interested in joining us. 

They can sign up by following this link: https://tinyletter.com/AutisticaTuringCitizenScience.

Warm wishes to all! 

## Project News

### Repository redesign

We've been doing more design work on the project's website and repository. We'd like everything to be easier to find and welcoming to newcomers! This is still a work in progress, but if you are interested have a look and let us know what you think? 

You can follow the work as it progresses by using this temporary link: https://github.com/katoss/AutisticaCitizenScience

### Feeling creative?

We're looking for autistic people who would like to: 

* help design diagrams to illustrate key parts of the project so that they are easier to underestand
* create artworks to showcase the community's amazing work.

If you would like to help out, please send an email and a visual design, drawing, or image you have made to Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

## User Testing

We have some wonderful volunteers to help us test the latest designs of the platform next month. Places for 1-2-1 user testing are full, but if you would like to give your feedback, there are lots of other ways to do it:

* [put your comments in our always-open google form](https://bit.ly/AutisticaTuringCitSciForm.)
* or email Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk

For September we will be looking for more volunteers to do user testing work. Please get in touch with Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk if you're interested. We'd especially like to hear from people who have special needs so we can make the platform inclusive for more people. 

## Presenting the project

July was the month of Autistica's first all-remote Research Festival! üëèüëèüëè There were some amazing presentations and inspiring people. Congratulations to everyone at Autistica for such a successful event! 

We hosted a live webinar on the project. The speakers were Kirstie Whitker and Georgia Aitkenhead from The Turing, and Craig Hall, Christopher Legg and Thomas Stanley from Fujitsu. 

Most exciting of all, two participants, Lucinda Marsden and Otis Smith, gave amazing talks on their own experiences of taking part in the citizen science project, and about what matters most to them. The webinar was filmed and will be made public, and we will share a link with you all as soon as it's available. 

In the meantime, the slides are available to view and download on Zenodo.

## Introducing Katharina

Every month, we're introducing a new member of the community to show the range of people involved in the project and the variety of contributions they're making.

If you'd like to be interviewed, or to interview someone else, please get in touch with Georgia at gaitkenhead@turing.ac.uk.

This month, we're delighted to introduce Katharina Kloppenborg. Katharina started on the project just a few weeks ago, and she has already done some very impressive work designing user testing sessions and redesigning oUr file management systems. We're absolutely thrilled to have her support. 

Here she is: 

And here she is in her own words:

Over the summer I will help to increase community involvement within the project. I'm collecting user feedback on the current version of the prototype and developing guidelines for future user tests, so that everyone can plan, perform and analyze these tests. I'm also working on how to make it easier for new contributors to get started. For example, I am reviewing and restructuring the various online resources of the project, especially the GitHub repository.
 
This September I will start a PhD in which I will investigate if peer production principles are transferable to citizen science platforms. I have never been involved in a citizen science project before, so I'm glad to be able to gather some first-hand experience now. I'm sure that contributing to the Autistica Citizen Science Platform will be very helpful in getting my PhD off to a successful start. Moreover, this is my first closer contact with people from the autistic community, and it is really interesting to learn how people perceive the world differently - most of which I (and I am sure that applies to many other people as well) was unaware before. So I think it is important to build this platform in order to create a means with which autistic people can share their experiences, to educate the general public and to create a valuable database for research. There is a wide range of tasks that new contributors of any background can support the project with, also many for which no coding skills are needed. Just have a look on the project's website or contact us, if you are interested!

Thank You!

A huge thank you is due to everyone in the community for all of your ongoing efforts and wonderful contributions. 
You are making a big difference in creating research which can benefit autistic people and their families. 

Very best wishes, 

Georgia, Kirstie, and Katharina
