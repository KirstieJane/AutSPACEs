# MONTH Newsletter YEAR

Hi everyone! Seasons greetings! Hope you've been enjoying the snow (if you're UK-based) and it's not caused too many problems for you! It's been a while since our last newsletter because we were on pause while our new team started and while Kirstie was on maternity leave. We'll be starting up regular newsletters and meet-up sessions again in January 2023, and we've got lots we're excited to share with you and to show you. So we wanted to send you lots of festive good cheer before the winter break and invite you to our first meet-up session of 2023:

We've been working hard to advocate for open and participatory research practices and share our view of the importance of research by and for the people for whom there is most at stake. Here's a selection of some of the talks we've given:

## Get involved

Our project consists of many different areas where we would love people to contribute and give us their thoughts and ideas.
It is really important we hear the voices and perspective of all of our community members.

Last year, we identified the following areas where we need your help:

* Communication, Engagement and Promotion
* Platform development
* Accessibility and Inclusion
* Moderation

We'll talk again about the different areas and routes to involvement in our meet-up session on the 12th January, so please do join in so we can **make AutSPACEs work for you**.

If you want to get stuck in ASAP and know how to use GitHub, you can visit our main repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs
If you look at the issues list in each of these, you can see a list of tasks that need to be completed, and we welcome anyone to contribute and get involved. We also invite you to take part (or start up) discussions on GitHub. You can do this by going to the repository and clicking on the "discussion" tab, where you can share your views:

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/discussions

If you're not too sure about GitHub but would like to know more, _The Turing Way Book_ has a whole section on how to get started for successful collaboration and involvement.
I highly recommend this book also for anyone who is interested in Open Source Research and Reproducibility!
