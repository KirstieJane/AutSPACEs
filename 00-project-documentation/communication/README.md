# Project communications

You can find (nearly) all of the official communications done by and on the AutSPACEs project in this folder.

## Contents

### Applications
This includes applications for funding, internships, conference presentations and so on.

### Newsletters
We send regular updates to our community to keep them updated on how the project is progressing.
This directory contains the original versions of these newsletters for our records and to make them easy to re-use in the future.

### Presentations
When we deliver presentations, we publish our slides openly on Zenodo.org. This folder contains links to those slides.

### Reports
Progress reports on AutSPACEs. These can be internal sprint updates or official reports we have written.
