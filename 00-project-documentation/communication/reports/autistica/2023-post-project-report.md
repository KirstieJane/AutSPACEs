# 2023 post project report for Autistica

## Please provide a summary of any project related activities that have happened over the last twelve months

Thanks to additional funding by The Alan Turing Institute, the AutSPACEs project has continued and progressed over the last 12 months. The additional funding has allowed the AutSPACEs team to grow by a senior researcher (Dr. Bastian Greshake Tzovaras) – to co-lead the project with Dr. Kirstie Whitaker – and 2 research software engineers to support the implementation of the AutSPACEs platform.
The funding has also allowed Georgia Aitkenhead to continue her contribution to the project.

Thanks to this grown team, AutSPACEs has made a number of key advancements: 

1. The content moderation approach for AutSPACEs – along with a paper outlining it – was co-produced between the research team and a group of autistic volunteer contributors: https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2xe7. The moderation approach that resulted from the co-design allows for sharing challenging experiences while creating a welcoming and inclusive space, balancing complex decisions and the duty of care for contributors. 
2. The team has created a functioning prototype that represents the minimum viable product to soon start collecting data. Users can now login, share experiences for research or publicly and the operationalization of the aforementioned content moderation guidelines is implemented to e.g. flag sensitive topics or reject experiences that go against the guidelines
3. At the end of July the AutSPACEs team got the ethics approval for performing formal usability studies, the team is now starting to do this user testing in 1:1 over-the-shoulder testing to improve on the prototype before its deployment 

Beyond those advances, the AutSPACEs team has continued to engage with the community through a number of pathways: 

- We sent out 8 newsletters to asynchronously update the community on the development progress, upcoming events such as communtiy meetups, webinars and conferences, etc.
- The team has held 7 community sessions between January and August 2023. Thanks to the development progresss, many of these sessions included informal demonstrations of the various AutSPACEs prototype stages to which the larger AutSPACEs community gave feedback. Additionally, we engaged further autism researchers. 
- The AutSPACEs co-design methodology was shared in academic conference talks and poster in four different countries to connect both with autism researchers and the wider citizen science and data science network. 

## Please detail the implications of any project related activities that have happened over the last twelve months

The work done over the last 12 months have brought the AutSPACEs project close to being able to launch the data collection phase. After the project had been delayed due to COVID-19 and issues around the software development in collaboration with Autistica's partnership with Fujitsu, the project now envisions to start the data collection phase at the end of 2023 after finalizing the user testing and improvements over the second half of 2023. 


## Have you had any project related publications, conference presentations, or other related outputs?

As mentioned above, the project has resulted in one publication that is currently under review in the journal "Data & Policy" and which is available as a preprint at:  https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/c2xe7 Two of the three joint-first-authors are autistic collaborators. 

The project was also presented at a number of conferences, outreach events: 

* AutSPACEs was presented as part of an international webinar series on "Public space, play & neurodiversity" on January 24th. The recording is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SfQeF1dwaM&t=1s 
* A presentation on citizen science generally & AutSPACEs in particular was given at CSVconf (April 18/19) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. slides are at https://zenodo.org/record/7843909, a recording is on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PATCQClwJqI&list=PLg5zZXwt2ZW6FyN4zJnfcU0b-zyZLxgzv&index=22
* Adjacent to this talk, AutSPACEs was featured in two outreach events in local schools in Buenos Aires
* AutSPACEs was highlighted in a poster presentation at the C\*Sci conference in Phoenix, AZ, USA. The poster available https://zenodo.org/record/7930597, as is the recording of the poster presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQCC9I4sUGQ
* AutSPACEs was presented at Bioinformatics Open Source Conference  in Lyon, France on July 24-25, the slides are available at https://zenodo.org/record/8164376. 
* Additionally, an AutSPACEs team member represented the project on a panel on "Open & Ethical Data Sharing" at the same event
* The above-mentioned preprint from AutSPACEs was also presented at a webinar on August 2, which concerned effective "Patient Public Involvement & Engagement" and which was funded by the NIHR-funded Community of Practice for PPIE.

Whenever the timing allowed, at least one autistic contributors co-presented our work as part of the research team – either in real-time or through a recorded statement. 

## Please detail any further work, plans, or projects that have stemmed from the original Autistica funded project

Beyond a continuation of the AutSPACEs project as outlined above, we have started to engage in an early brainstorming phase with a mixed team of autistic and neuro-typical researchers to explore how the AutSPACEs approach could be adapted to collect data for another reseach question – in particular surrounding the phenomenology of Autism. 

## Please leave any final comments or feedback on the project and your work (optional)
