Abstract (1000 characters)
--------------------------

Historically, research on Autism has often been performed on, rather than by or with, autistic people.  This has led to both ethical issues and research that focuses on topics with limited benefit to autistic people. Citizen science offers a way to potentially address these issues. With AutSPACEs we are collectively exploring this potential -- through an open and participatory online citizen science project that focuses on better understanding sensory processing in built environments. This research topic was chosen as a priority to the autistic community, as it addresses a real-world need. The implementation of our research is done collectively in an inclusive community which includes autistic people, open source developers, and academic researchers. Collectively, we use co-creation design methods and open source philosophies to guarantee the equitable co-ownership of all of our outputs and ensure that they are reusable and useful to generate real-world impact.

Description (5000 characters)
-----------------------------

AutSPACEs -- short for Autism research into Sensory Processing for Accessible Community Environments --  is a community-led citizen science project seeking to make environments more accessible for autistic people. Around 90% of autistic people process sensory information differently to non-autistic people. As a result, many public spaces are not well designed for autistic people. For example, they may be too bright, busy or loud. Prior research on sensory processing and autism has mostly overlooked the lived experience of autistic people, thus failing to generalise to real world environments. AutSPACEs aims to fill this gap by conducting co-created research into sensory processing to enable accessible community environments. The project started in 2019 as a collaboration between the Alan Turing Institute and the Autistica Foundation and follows the disability rights movement's motto of "Nothing about us, without us". To achieve this, the project is co-designed by autistic people with the expressed goal to empower autistic people throughout the process.

We started the project by holding focus groups, to collaboratively refine the project goals and explore potential approaches. These sessions were attended by a diverse audience, including autistic adults, parents of autistic children, researchers and people at the intersections of categories (e.g. autistic adults who are parents to autistic children). Thanks to this community input, we moved from only collecting sensory processing experiences in day-to-day life to also recording recommendations of what could have made those experiences better. Such recommendations include personal coping strategies that can be useful to others as well as suggestions to designers of environments for making them more accessible. Through this change, AutSPACEs grew into a joint repository of qualitative data for sensory processing experiences and improvement strategies. AutSPACEs can thus not only serve as a research data set for understanding sensory processing, but also (i) provide peer-support through shared adaptive strategies, (ii) educate neurotypical people on the challenges encountered by autistic friends, family members or colleagues, and (iii) help organisations and policy makers on accessibility challenges in public spaces.

Following the goal setting, we implemented a co-creation and co-leadership model for developing our citizen science platform: Embodying our project values, our platform is based on and being implemented as an open source system, accessible at <https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/>. As part of our commitment to openness and transparency, we hold monthly community meetings for open discussion and coworking and also release all documentation on decision making as well as collected data -- including from focus groups/workshops as well as the actual experiences recorded through the platform -- in anonymised form following FAIR principles.

Our collaborative co-design has been key to support the diverse needs of our autistic community, including filling gaps in current research: A key example of this is the co-designed AutSPACEs content moderation approach. Collectively, our community discovered a number of community-specific dilemmas around content moderation, including how to handle potentially triggering experiences and how to support reports where non-autistic people speak on behalf of autistic people (e.g. in case of parents or caretakers). Collaboratively, our community agreed on how to make trade-offs around these issues, leading not only to our community spear-heading the creation of our content moderation guidelines, but also to an academic paper that outlines how co-design helped us make informed decisions and which was co-authored by both academic researchers & autistic community members (see attached file).

Over the course of 2023, we have finalised the creation of a working AutSPACEs platform prototype. This process included a further iterative design improvement through two rounds of usability testing with autistic contributors, including 20 participants completely new to the project. At this stage, we are ready to start the data collection through the AutSPACEs platform. We already got the conditional ethics approval for this, and having just finished the recommended changes are now just waiting for the full approval.

Our open design process not only helped us to build a diverse & inclusive project but also allowed us to collaborate and network with other research efforts across the EU: For example, we have worked with the "ASD Publics" project on a workshop «Public space, play and neurodiversity: Challenges towards an urban european agenda» with researchers from France, Spain and Wales. Furthermore, we are also connected with the French citizen science project "AutiSenCité" which aims to implement an approach similar to AutSPACEs in France and are actively sharing materials and processes with them.

Research question (1500 characters)
-----------------------------------

Autistic people have sensory processing sensitivities & differences compared to non-autistic people. These differences include the "big five" senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste), balance and body awareness; and can be categorised by an over-sensitivity, under-sensitivity, a combination of both, and be variable over time. This can make it hard to navigate environments not built with autistic people in mind, such as busy trains or brightly lit hospital rooms. Because of these impacts, AutSPACEs tackles two questions prioritised by the autistic community: What unique sensory processing challenges are encountered by autistic people? And what could make environments better for autistic people?

Outside controlled laboratory experiments, there is a gap in data on these questions in real-world settings. AutSPACEs tries to fill this data gap together with autistic people by collecting qualitative data on participants' lived experiences around sensory processing in different spaces. Our project has four goals: (1) Collect data to improve our understanding of sensory processing in people's daily lives (2) Allow people to share their experiences and coping strategies to support others (3) Give non-autistic people a way to learn about the experiences of autistic people, allowing them to better understand the challenges and provide better support (4) Allow this data to be used by policy makers and creators of spaces and environments, to improve inclusion for autistic people.

Initiative Team (1500 characters)
---------------------------------

Our team consists of a diverse group of contributors, of all neurotypes, and with backgrounds in a variety of academic disciplines. At the Alan Turing Institute, the AutSPACEs team consists of Dr. Kirstie Whitaker, Dr. Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, Georgia Aitkenhead and Sophia Batchelor, with past contributions from software engineers Helen Duncan, Callum Mole, Martin Stoffel and David Llewellyn-Jones. James Cusack of Autistica co-developed the initial project idea with the Turing team. The project also had support from civil servants on secondment (Lotty Coupat & Amol Prabhu). Internationally, Master & PhD students with backgrounds in digital sciences and human-computer interaction (Sowmya Rajan, Soledad Li, Katharina Kloppenborg) from Université Paris Cité supported the development & design efforts.

Outside the academic institutions, the AutSPACEs team consists of a large group of community contributors: This includes Susanna Fantoni and James Scott, who co-designed and supported the implementation of the content moderation for public experiences. Robin Taylor and James Kim contributed to the engineering of the AutSPACEs platform. The Autistica Discover Network and Insight groups have contributed significantly to the co-creation of the platform. The AutSPACEs team further consists of dozens of volunteer contributors that engage in user testing, participate in our monthly, virtual community meetups and give detailed feedback and advice. 

Citizen Engagement: give a profile of the community of citizen scientists and their role, incl recruitment (1500 characters)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the open nature of AutSPACEs, we support a wide range of citizen science profiles and varying levels of engagement, allowing people to engage as much as they can & want at different time periods. The participants have different backgrounds professionally, but also in personal interest for the project, e.g. due as an autistic person, a parent/caretaker/friend of autistic people.

On a basic level, citizen scientists can share their own sensory processing experiences through the AutSPACEs platform, including by making them publicly available for others to read as well. Similarly, citizen scientists can engage with the project in a "silent reading" capability, by reading through published experiences to learn from them.

Citizen scientists can & do engage more deeply in varying other capabilities: They (1) join our monthly community meetups to connect more with other citizen scientists and the team (2) participate in focus groups/co-design workshops to contribute to the project- and platform-design of AutSPACEs (3) act active code contributors, and (4) will soon be able to become moderators to help with the day-to-day governance of published experiences. Furthermore, we include citizen scientists in academic and public dissemination of the project (writing up outputs, delivering talks, etc).

The recruitment and onboarding is facilitated through newsletters, social media, community meetups and transparent project management on GitHub.

How will the prize money benefit your community? (1500 characters)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The prize money would allow us to build out the AutSPACEs online platform further. In the short term, we are particularly interested in expanding the accessibility options of it. Given the sensory processing differences experienced by autistic people, it is virtually impossible to have a single platform design that works for everyone (e.g. one participant's "too much contrast" can be another participant's "too little contrast"). The prize money would allow us to invest into a dedicated designer to help us implement a more modular/customizable approach, helping us make the platform more inclusive.

In the mid-term it would also allow us to explore different options to move the data collection beyond purely text-based experiences. Given the different abilities and needs of participants, we have been guided by our community  to expand into supporting the sharing of experiences in images/audio/video formats to include a larger part of the autistic community. Given the added complexity and storage requirements, the prize money could enable some of these approaches.

Last but not least, the prize money could help sustain AutSPACEs in the long-term. Beyond the institutional and volunteer support for the creation and implementation of the project -- as well as the facilitation of community engagement -- running the platform long-term requires the financial ability to run the digital infrastructure, which the prize money could support as well.

Support received from / Funding (1000 characters)
-------------------------------------------------

The initial funding for AutSPACEs was provided by the Autistica Foundation, a UK-based charity with the mission to enable all autistic people to live happier, healthier, longer lives and which aims to achieve its mission by funding research, shaping policy and working with autistic people. Additionally, the Alan Turing Institute continues to support the project by providing staff time. In the past the French Inserm unit U1284 has provided in-kind support through students working on the project as well. The user testing in 2023 was done with financial support by the Software Sustainability Institute. Beyond those organisational support, AutSPACEs has and continues to receive rich support in time and expertise from its open source contributors and volunteers working on the project.

Software used (1000 characters)
-------------------------------

AutSPACEs as an online platform itself is an evolving open-source project which is licensed under the MIT licence. In turn the platform development is made possible by a wide range of existing and well-established open source tools and packages: The platform is written in Python, using the open-source web framework Django and Postgres as its local database backend. Furthermore, given the potentially sensitive nature of people's experiences and to ensure users have full control of their data, AutSPACEs uses the Open Humans infrastructure to handle the storage of personal data, pseudonymization and consent. Open Humans itself is open source as well and run by a non-profit providing infrastructure for citizen science.

History (3000 characters):
--------------------------

Our community started to form in 2019 around the development of the AutSPACEs platform, kickstarted by a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and Autistica. Through working with focus groups, regular community meetups, and national and international collaborators our community has expanded substantially into an interdisciplinary team that conveins academic researchers and citizen scientists -- and neurodiverse and neurotypical participants -- alike.

Within The Alan Turing Institute, our team currently includes: Kirstie Whitaker and Bastian Greshake Tzovaras as co-PIs for the project; Georgia Aitkenhead and Sophia Batchelor are working on the community engagement and project management; and Helen Duncan, Callum Mole, Martin Stoffel and David Llewellyn-Jones from the Research Engineering Group have supported us in the technical development, in particular the web-development for the AutSPACEs backend.

A highly active base of volunteer contributors is equally responsible for making AutSPACEs the vibrant and inclusive community and project that it is. To name a few contributors that are currently highly active: Susanna Fantoni and James Scott are active contributors who remain key for the design of inclusive and safe moderation features to centre autistic people's voices. Robin Taylor and James Kim contribute software development, platform design, technical infrastructure and testing. In past years a large number of additional contributors has participated in AutSPACEs, through contributions in focus groups or offline-workshops, during community calls, or by contributing to the project on GitHub.

Between 2020 and 2022, our community was complemented through further institutional support from a variety of sources: Master & PhD students working at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and studying at Universite Paris Cite, including Katharina Kloppenborg, who performed focus groups and usability tests of different platform prototypes; Sowmya Rajan, who helped with documentation, coding and design; and Soledad Li, who developed frontend designs for the platform. During this time, our community also included two members of the UK Civil Service Fast Stream: Lotty Coupat and Amol Prabhu contributed to AutSPACEs with mentoring and project management capacities.

Over time, our community has also expanded in geographical scope: By now, it has moved beyond the UK and now brings together both citizen scientists and academic researchers that use citizen science in their own autism research projects from a range of countries including the United States, Spain, and France.
