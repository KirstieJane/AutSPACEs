## Hacking's Human Kinds and the Ethics of Participatory Science 

Drawing on Hacking’s ([1996](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524021.001.0001/acprof-9780198524021-chapter-12)) influential concept of the ‘looping effects of human kinds’, this paper will explore the ethical implications of the dynamics between researchers and research subjects in scientific practice. 
We argue that scientists engaged in work about human kinds have a moral duty to include research subjects in their work. 
We will then ground the theoretical discussion with a case study of participatory science in action: a project to build a tool to investigate autism and sensory processing through the participatory co-creation of a citizen science platform. 
This project is a collaboration between the UK-based research charity Autistica and The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for AI and data science. 
More detail, current work, outputs, resources and engagement pathways are all available on the [project’s repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience).

The presentation of this paper will itself follow participatory practices: it will be co-presented by an autistic participant, point attendees to open and transparent research protocols and data, and everyone will be invited to join as collaborators.

We begin by exploring how existing scientific practices base themselves on a division between researchers and research subjects. 
To do so, we explore Hacking’s account of human kinds and provide the example of autism. 
We briefly review recent trends in the study of autism and argue that the gap traditionally conceived between “knowers” and those who are “known” raises ethical concerns.

The ethical concerns we discuss are similar to those of feminist scholars at large and standpoint theorists in particular. 
We will consider what Miranda Fricker ([2007](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198237907.001.0001/acprof-9780198237907)) calls “epistemic injustice”. 
By Fricker’s account, prejudice about certain stereotypes render their testimony noncredible. 
When these stereotypes are incorrect, an epistemic injustice is produced. 
This is because social injustices are perpetuated through incorrectly assigned stereotypes. Despite the research subject being the expert of their own experience, research findings are afforded validity by scientific institutions and authority by society. 
This results in social policies and norms that further reproduce social injustices. Such divisions are further entrenched by societal inequality which can create barriers to scientific institutions and education.

Fletcher-Watson et. al., (2019) further emphasise the cruciality of interrogating and redressing power disbalance. Power asymmetry is associated with significant adverse effects for those disempowered. On an individual level, power asymmetry can lower self-esteem (Wojciszke & Struzynska–Kujalowicz, 2007), reduce a sense of agency (Martin et al., 2003), and lead to reduced empathy in those wielding power, who can pathologize difference as dysfunction (Galinsky, Magee, Inesi, & Gruenfeld, 2006). 

Having problematised the division between “knowers” and “known”, we return to Hacking’s looping effects to argue that, given the self-reflecting nature of human kinds, scientists ought to integrate this into their practice. 
In other words, given that researchers, in “knowing” about the social world, shape the very subject they study, they should fix the ethical principles guiding their research from the start. 
To both fix these ethical principles and study human kinds, we suggest that bringing research subjects into the research process presents an ethically compelling means of conducting science that is pertinent to human kinds.

Thus, we explore tools available in participatory science and that show promise in redressing the key concerns laid out. 
We will examine the effects of including research subjects in the critical aspects of research, such as priority-setting, data gathering, the creation of protocols, analysis, and the interpretation and communication of findings. 
We argue that there are benefits both for the research itself and those who take part in it. We also suggest that participatory research is a means of supporting the inclusion and empowerment of traditionally marginalised groups in science. 

We make this case by referencing autism in particular and drawing on existing participatory frameworks as well as new findings emerging from co-creation sessions with autistic people. 
We use a current, ongoing participatory project as a case study to ground the discussion. 
It aims to co-create an online citizen science platform enabling autistic people to share their experiences of sensory processing in their daily lives. 
Possible means of engagement and routes to involvement of diverse participants will be explored. 
We will share learning from the citizen science project and offer practical guidance for those interested in incorporating participatory practices in their own research. 
We will point to challenges and limitations of participatory science in relation to each of the tools discussed as well as more generally. 
Finally, we will demonstrate means of involvement in the project, and warmly encourage collaboration.
