## Abstract (1000 characters)

Historically, research on Autism has often been performed on, rather than by or with, autistic people.  This has led to both ethical issues and research that focuses on topics with limited benefit to autistic people. Citizen science offers a way to potentially address these issues. With AutSPACEs we are collectively exploring this potential – through an open and participatory online citizen science project that focuses on better understanding sensory processing in built environments. This research topic was chosen as a priority to the autistic community, as it addresses a real-world need. The implementation of our research is done collectively in an inclusive community which includes autistic people, open source developers, and academic researchers. Collectively, we use co-creation design methods and open source philosophies to guarantee the equitable co-ownership of all of our outputs and ensure that they are reusable and useful to generate real-world impact.


## Description (5000 characters)

AutSPACEs – short for _Autism research into Sensory Processing for Accessible Community Environments _–  is a community-led citizen science project seeking to make environments more accessible for autistic people. Around 90% of autistic people process sensory information differently to non-autistic people. As a result, many public spaces are not well designed for autistic people. For example, they may be too bright, busy or loud. Prior research on sensory processing and autism has mostly been conducted in  laboratory settings and has overlooked the lived experience of autistic people, thus failing to generalise to real world environments. AutSPACEs is trying to fill this gap, by conducting co-created research into sensory processing to enable accessible community environments. The project started in 2019 as a collaboration between the Alan Turing Institute and the Autistica Foundation and follows the disability rights movement’s motto of “Nothing about us, without us”. To achieve this, the project is co-designed by autistic people with the expressed goal to empower autistic people throughout the process. 

In the initial stages of the project, we held a number of scoping sessions and co-facilitated focus groups with autistic people, to collaboratively identify the exact goals of the project and explore solutions to achieve these goals. These focus groups were attended by a diverse audience, including autistic adults, parents of autistic children and researchers and people at the intersection of multiple categories (e.g. being an autistic person who is the parent of an autistic child). We started with the plan to have an online citizen science platform that enables autistic people to share their experiences around sensory processing in day-to-day life. The input by autistic people expanded the scope by an important factor: the community wished to also record recommendations of what could have made sensory processing experiences better. These recommendations could be personal coping strategies that can be useful to others, or wishes to the designers/architects of spaces for what could make the environments more accessible and inclusive. 

AutSPACEs adapted to this community recommendation to become a joint repository of qualitative data on both sensory processing experiences and strategies for how to improve them. Thanks to this, AutSPACEs can not only serve to be a research data set to better understand sensory processing, but also provides peer-support to autistic people by discovering adaptive strategies that helped others, educates neurotypical people about the challenges encountered by their autistic friends, family members or colleagues, and helps advise organisations and policy on how to improve the accessibility of public spaces.

Since the initial goal setting, AutSPACEs implemented a co-creation and co-leadership model for the development of its citizen science platform: The platform is based on, and itself being implemented as, an open source system that is publicly available at [https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutSPACEs/) alongside all documentation on how decisions are being made. As part of this commitment to openness and transparency, AutSPACEs holds monthly community meetings for open discussion and coworking on the platform. Furthermore, all data collected by AutSPACEs – including from focus groups/workshops as well as the actual experiences recorded through the platform – are shared in anonymised form following FAIR principles. 

Our collaborative work has been key in supporting the needs of an autistic community, and addressing the gaps in current research. For example, how to handle the reporting of experiences being submitted by others on behalf of an autistic person. Often, research has centred on second-hand experiences with non-autistic people speaking for autistic people (e.g. parents/caretakers) leading to inaccurate and biassed results that do not accurately reflect the experience of autistic people. As a result, such reports are contentious with some people preferring to support only first-hand experiences being recorded. At the same time, the role of a carer is critical in supporting non-verbal autistic people to write and share their experience. Collaboratively, the community made the trade-off to allow second-hand reports, and implemented a Code of Conduct to guide second-hand reporters in sharing experiences. This Code of Conduct was co-developed with the community and also addressed issues around content moderation and how to store and display experiences that are potentially distressing, while not putting readers at risk. This working group developed customised moderation guidance and designed a set of trigger warnings established to safeguard an online autistic community. 

Overall, the open and collaborative design process behind AutSPACEs has helped us to enable an inclusive citizen science project that supports a diverse range of participants and goals.


## Research question (1500 characters)

Autistic people have sensory processing sensitivities & differences compared to non-autistic people. These differences include the “big five” senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste), balance and body awareness; and can be categorised by an over-sensitivity, under-sensitivity, a combination of both, and be variable over time. This can make it hard to navigate environments not built with autistic people in mind, such as busy trains or brightly lit hospital rooms. Because of these impacts, AutSPACEs tackles two questions prioritised by the autistic community: What unique sensory processing challenges are encountered by autistic people? And what could make environments better for autistic people? 

Outside controlled laboratory experiments, there is a gap in data on these questions in real-world settings. AutSPACEs tries to fill this data gap together with autistic people by collecting qualitative data on participants’ lived experiences around sensory processing in different spaces. Our project has four goals: (1) Collect data to improve our understanding of sensory processing in people’s daily lives (2) Allow people to share their experiences and coping strategies to support others (3) Give non-autistic people a way to learn about the experiences of autistic people, allowing them to better understand the challenges and provide better support (4) Allow this data to be used by policy makers and creators of spaces and environments, to improve inclusion for autistic people.


## Initiative Team (1500 characters)

The team consists of a diverse group of contributors, of all neurotypes, with backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. At the Alan Turing Institute, the AutSPACEs team consists of Dr. Kirstie Whitaker (Co-PI), Dr. Bastian Greshake Tzovaras (Co-PI), Georgia Aitkenhead (Research Associate), Sophia Batchelor (Community Manager), Helen Duncan (Software Engineer) and Callum Mole (Software Engineer). James Cusack of Autistica co-developed the initial project idea with the Turing team. The project also had support from civil servants on secondment (Lotty Coupat & Amol Prabhu). Internationally, Master & PhD students with backgrounds in digital sciences and human-computer interaction (Sowmya Rajan, Soledad Li, Katharina Kloppenborg) from Université Paris Cité supported the development & design efforts.

Outside these institutions, the AutSPACEs team consists of an active group of open source contributors. Susanna Fantoni and James Scott were key to designing the content moderation for public experiences and remain instrumental in the implementation into the AutSPACEs online platform, Robin Taylor and James Kim are key contributors to the open source code behind AutSPACEs. The Autistica Discover Network and Insight groups have contributed significantly to the co-creation of the platform. The AutSPACEs team further consists of dozens of volunteer contributors that engage in user testing, participate in our monthly, virtual community meetups and give detailed feedback and advice. 


## Citizen Engagement: give a profile of the community of citizen scientists and their role, incl recruitment (1500 characters)

Given the open nature of AutSPACEs, the project supports a wide range of citizen science profiles and varying levels of engagement, allowing people to engage as deeply or little as wanted or appropriate for them at different time periods. The participants have different backgrounds professionally, but also in personal interest for the project, e.g. due to being an autistic person, a parent/caretaker/friend of autistic people. 

On the lower levels of engagement, citizen scientists can share their own experiences on sensory processing through the AutSPACEs platform, either privately, for research use, or by making them publicly available for others to read as well. Similarly, citizen scientists can engage with the project in a “silent reading” capability, by reading through published experiences to learn from them. 

Citizen scientists that wish to engage more have a wide range of options, all of which we have seen different contributors take: They can (1) join our monthly community meetups to connect more with other citizen scientists and the team (2) participate in focus groups/co-design workshops to contribute to the project- and platform-design of AutSPACEs (3) be active code contributors, and (4) will soon be able to become moderators to help with the day-to-day governance of published experiences. 

The recruitment and onboarding is facilitated through newsletters, social media, community meetups and transparent project management on GitHub.


## How will the prize money benefit your community? (1500 characters)

The prize money would allow us to build out the AutSPACEs online platform further. In the short term, we are particularly interested in expanding the accessibility options of it. Given the sensory processing differences experienced by autistic people, it is virtually impossible to have a single platform design that works for everyone (e.g. one participant’s “too much contrast” can be another participant's “too little contrast”). The prize money would allow us to invest into a dedicated designer to help us implement a more modular/customizable approach, helping us make the platform more inclusive. 

In the mid-term it would also allow us to explore different options to move the data collection beyond purely text-based experiences. Given the different abilities and needs of participants, we have been guided by our community  to expand into supporting the sharing of experiences in images/audio/video formats to include a larger part of the autistic community. Given the added complexity and storage requirements, the prize money could enable some of these approaches. 

Last but not least, the prize money could help sustain AutSPACEs in the long-term. Beyond the institutional and volunteer support for the creation and implementation of the project – as well as the facilitation of community engagement – running the platform long-term requires the financial ability to run the digital infrastructure, which the prize money could support as well.


## Support received from / Funding (1000 characters)

The initial funding for AutSPACEs was provided by the Autistica Foundation, a UK-based charity with the mission to enable all autistic people to live happier, healthier, longer lives and which aims to achieve its mission by funding research, shaping policy and working with autistic people. Additionally, the Alan Turing Institute continues to support the project by providing staff time. In the past the French Inserm unit U1284 has provided in-kind support through students working on the project as well. Beyond those organisational support, AutSPACEs has and continues to receive rich support in time and expertise from its open source contributors and volunteers working on the project.

Autism, open source, online platform, co-creation, sensory processing, urban environment, built spaces, inclusion, diversity


## Software used (1000 characters)

AutSPACEs as an online platform itself is an evolving open-source project which is licensed under the MIT licence. In turn the platform development is made possible by a wide range of existing and well-established open source tools and packages: The platform is written in Python, using the open-source web framework Django and Postgres as its local database. Furthermore, given the potentially sensitive nature of people’s experiences and to ensure users have full control of their data, AutSPACEs uses the Open Humans infrastructure to handle the storage of personal data, pseudonymization and consent. Open Humans itself is open source as well and run by a non-profit providing infrastructure for citizen science.

## History (3000 characters):

Our community  started to form in 2019 around the development of the AutSPACEs platform, kickstarted by the collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute and Autistica. Through working with focus groups, regular community meetups, and national and international collaborators our community has expanded substantially into an interdisciplinary team that conveins academic researchers and citizen scientists – and neurodiverse and neurotypical participants – alike. 

Within The Alan Turing Institute, our team currently includes: Kirstie Whitaker and Bastian Greshake Tzovaras as co-PIs for the project; Georgia Aitkenhead and Sophia Batchelor are working on the community engagement and project management; and Callum Mole and Helen Duncan within the Research Engineering Group to support the technical development, in particular the web-development for the AutSPACEs backend. 

A highly active base of volunteer contributors is equally responsible for making AutSPACEs the vibrant and inclusive community and project that it is. To name a few contributors that are currently highly active: Susanna Fantoni and James Scott are active contributors who remain key for the design of inclusive and safe moderation features to centre autistic people’s voices. Robin Taylor and James Kim contribute software development, platform design, technical infrastructure and testing. In past years a large number of additional contributors has participated in AutSPACEs, through contributions in focus groups or offline-workshops, during community calls, or by contributing to the project on GitHub. 

Between 2020 and 2022, our community was complemented through further institutional support from a variety of sources: Master & PhD students working at the French _National Institute of Health and Medical Research_ (Inserm) and studying at _Universite Paris Cite_, including Katharina Kloppenborg, who performed focus groups and usability tests of different platform prototypes; Sowmya Rajan, who helped with documentation, coding and design; and Soledad Li, who developed frontend designs for the platform. During this time, our community also included two members of the UK Civil Service Fast Stream: Lotty Coupat and Amol Prabhu contributed to AutSPACEs with mentoring and project management capacities.
