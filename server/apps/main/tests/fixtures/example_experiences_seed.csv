clothing and job interviews,"I recently had a job interview for a bigger company than I have been in before. It was my first job interview in 4 years and I was incredibly nervous. My autism makes job interviews so much more difficult as I feel like I have to mask, as well as having difficulty with verbal reasoning (it takes me longer to process what people have said and think on my feet - a skill which is very important for interviewing). On top of all of this, there is an understanding that people attend an interview in their “Sunday best” meaning clothing that looks very corporate. Many of the clothing types that look this way have overlocked seams and are polyester blends so I find them itchy and incredibly distracting. The week leading up to the job interview I was more nervous about having to wear clothes that made me uncomfortable than the actual questions I might be asked. I find that normally when I stay at home (flexible working and work from home has been a blessing in this regard) I can wear clothing that makes me feel comfortable and therefore I am more able to actually get things done. On the day of the interview, I was getting so overwhelmed by the fabric of my shirt and the seams of my socks and did very very poorly in the actual interview (surprise I didn’t get the job). If I had been able to wear clothing that I was comfortable in, this wouldn’t have been a problem and I would have performed better in the interview.","I wish I could have worn clothes that I was comfortable in, a cotton t-shirt, jeans, and my favourite slippers.",
open office,Working in the office can often be difficult. We have hot desking so I never know where I’m going to be sitting or who else will be there. The lights are very bright as well which can be difficult as it gives me headaches. It can also be loud which makes it difficult to concentrate on my work. The commute can also be stressful if the trains are crowded and I have to take the underground.,I try to get in early so that I can get my regular desk which is more in the corner away from the bright lights. I also often wear my headphones whilst working. I sometimes try and work non-standard hours to avoid the big crowds.,
"cafes, pubs etc","I enjoy meeting friends and people, but a lot of places are not designed for me to enjoy this: At cafes, bars, restaurants there are too many people at the same time, the lights are too dim for me to see comfortably and the noise level is so high that I can not understand what people say.",I wish people would design places for lower noise levels and with better lighting. Or that my friends understood that those places are not fun for me to meet them. I try to meet up with my friends 1:1 in places that work better for me.,
hangry,"I’ve always found it so difficult going to restaurants. When I’m hungry everything sounds even louder and feels even more intimidating. As a kid, I never understood why it was so hard and my parents would often get mad at me for ‘misbehaving’ in public. I’d just meltdown whenever we went out to eat. Waiting for the food felt like some kind of marathon and I just got so overwhelmed. But now that I’ve realised hunger exacerbates my sensory differences I know how to cope.",I try to make sure I’ve eaten something before I go out and a while back I bought some earplugs which are great for small and bustling places. Looking at menus beforehand also helps as I can better prep myself and focus on adjusting to the environment rather than debating what to eat. I do wish restaurants wouldn’t play super loud music. I get it adds to the ambience but having even one section that’s quiet would be so helpful.,mentalhealth
spatial perception,"My lack of spatial awareness is probably the most debilitating part of my autism. I’m constantly walking into door frames and tripping over the corners of furniture even in my own home. And have a terrible habit of walking backwards into old women in shopping aisles. It’s been super hard with COVID as I’ve had to be in full ‘defensive mode’ whenever I go out, making sure I’m not too near to anyone. However, I feel it most when I’m playing sports. I think I’m marking someone but they're actually halfway across the pitch. Or I call for the ball thinking I’m in a clear space when in reality there are three players standing right behind me. It’s even harder if there’s more than one game going on as I find it hard to focus on just one sound and I tend to use my hearing as a way of working out whether people are near me or not. Because autism is an invisible disability I feel like people don’t understand and just see me as a bad player. At times this gets really upsetting. It takes so much effort for me to participate in group activities because of my social anxiety, so if I feel like I’m underperforming it sometimes gets too much. ","I think shops need to be more aware of spatial issues. Stop putting piles of things in the middle of aisles! In social situations, I just wish people were more aware. If I’m playing football and you’re on my team, tell me where the opponents are.",
tv brightness,"My family recently got a new TV. It’s much larger than our previous one and has limited screen settings. 3/ 4 are too bright for me but my family dislikes the fourth option. I don’t often watch telly with the family but I feel like I should have the option to. It just feels unfair, I get that I’m a minority but they don’t see what I see and the fact that they won’t adapt to my needs upsets me. My parents are constantly nagging me to spend less time in my room but it’s situations like this that make me do just that. I can regulate my input in my own space and I can’t elsewhere.",Well firstly TVs need more options and the menu should be easy to navigate. But like with so much it’s just a matter of awareness and others actually having a willingness to adapt.,
clothes,"Being autistic it is so hard to find clothes that are comfortable and fit my body shape. I hate tight things but have really large breasts. So I tend to wear a large in order to avoid that feeling of being smothered. My parents and sisters often find this weird and tell me I look fat because of the clothes I wear. Sometimes, I look at myself in the mirror and hate what I see. I do look like an obese boy. But I’m not, I’m a girl and I just don’t know how to balance comfort with fashion.","I really wish people were more aware of how uncomfortable clothes can be. There are adaptive ranges for people with medical gear, I just wish there was a similar awareness for autism. This is why I like knitting, I can make clothes that fit just as I want them to.",negbody
