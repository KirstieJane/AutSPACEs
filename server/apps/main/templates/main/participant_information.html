            <p>
                Many autistic people have sensory processing sensitivities and differences when compared to non-autistic people. 
                These differences can make it difficult to navigate environments that were not built with autistic people in mind. 
                For example, it can be stressful to take a busy train during rush hour, or to attend an appointment in a brightly lit hospital waiting room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every person is different. We want to gather many autistic people’s stories together. 
                
                Our goal is to 
                <ol>
                <li>share them with people who have similar experiences,</li>
                <li>educate neurotypical people on how they can better support autistic people, and</li>
                <li>advise people on how they can design and adapt spaces to improve autistic people’s lives.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    The purpose of this platform is to enable research on sensory differences experienced by autistic people 
                    by collecting sensory processing experiences from autistic people in an ethical, participatory way 
                    using a citizen science approach.

            </p>
            <p>
                “Citizen-science” is when non-professional scientists directly contribute to scientific research and are involved 
                in the research process. This could be, for example, by performing tasks, analysing data, or contributing data.
            </p>
            <p>
            An online “platform” is a way of collecting and sharing data from people.

            <p>
                The best research about autism is done in close collaboration with autistic people. 
                Participatory citizen science is a way of doing research that involves many people contributing to the project. 
                Citizen scientists do not have to be paid academic researchers (in fact most are not) and participatory means 
                that we will include a large and broad range of people, including non-professional scientists, 
                in the direction and design of the work.  
            </p>
            <p> 
                We particularly invite autistic people and the carers and relatives of autistic people to contribute to the project. 
                The eligibility criteria to be part of this study are that participants are aged 18 or over and have 
                capacity to give informed consent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is based in the United Kingdom and is mainly interested in the perspectives of participants 
                based in the United Kingdom.

        <div class="code-of-conduct">
          <h5 class="heading-blue" id="take-part">Do I have to take part</h5>
            <p>
                Taking part is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without having to give a reason.  
            </p> 
            <p>
                If you withdraw consent all your shared data will no longer be available for further research. 
                But research projects that have already accessed your data are unlikely to be able to redact it form their datasets, 
                this is particularly true if any publications have been made.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="code-of-conduct">
            <h5 class="heading-blue" id="what-will-happen">What will happen if I choose to take part in AutSPACEs?</h5>
            <p>
                If you join AutSPACEs you will be able to contribute your own stories around sensory processing experiences 
                in text form, alongside recommendations of what would have made that experience better. 
                Additionally, we ask you to fill in a small profile with demographic information 
                (age, gender, and whether you identify as autistic). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Entering any of these data is optional and participation more broadly is voluntary. 
                For each story or experience you share you can choose whether you want to allow its use for research 
                and/or if you want to make it publicly accessible for others to read as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you <b>choose to share your experience for research</b>, your story will be part of a research dataset 
                alongside other people’s experiences that have also agreed for those experiences to be used for research. 
                Our research team at The Alan Turing Institute will then be able to use that experience to provide some 
                initial analyses and improve how AutSPACEs collects new experiences based on such data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, the AutSPACEs team could want to share those data with additional researchers or for more 
                in-depth research. In such cases, the AutSPACEs team would inform you of those plans via the 
                Open Humans messaging system, allowing you to change your consent if you wish to do so. 
                We encourage you to monitor those messages from Open Humans and to remain registered to our 
                newsletter to ensure you are kept up to date with proposals for new analyses of your data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you <b>choose to make your experience public</b>, your experience will first be checked over by a 
                moderator to make sure it follows our content moderation guidelines. 
                If you opt-in to receive notifications, we will let you know when a moderator has decided about 
                your experience. If your story follows our code of conduct, it will be published anonymously 
                on this website. Anyone will be able to view your story, 
                but your name will be kept private. 
                You can make this choice by checking the box ‘share online with everyone’. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Both sharing for research and making stories are optional, you can also choose neither</b>, 
                in which case you can personally see your stories, but they won’t be publicly listed or used for research.

                Yes. Your email address and username are only stored on the Open Humans system,
